In T the number 2 (red) marks the boundary pixels and the number 1 (blue) marks the fill; ignore cells with 0. (For example, if the upper pattern contains a row with [2,1,1,2] and subsequent rows with a single 1 or a block of 1’s, then T is the minimal rectangle covering all those cells.)\n3. In the remaining (lower) part of the grid, identify each contiguous group of rows that is meant to reproduce the reference pattern. A lower group is defined as a maximal set of consecutive rows (after the reference group) that contain at least one colored (nonzero) cell or are adjacent to a row that has been modified.\n4. For each lower group, determine its bounding box – that is, the minimal rectangle (with top row R₁, bottom row R₂, left column C₁, and right column C₂) that covers all cells in that group which are either originally nonzero or will be part of the filled pattern.\n5. For every cell (r, c) inside the bounding box of a lower group (where r ranges from R₁ to R₂ and c from C₁ to C₂), compute normalized coordinates u = (r – R₁)/(R₂ – R₁) and v = (c – C₁)/(C₂ – C₁). Then map these to a corresponding cell in the reference template T by letting t_r = round(u × (Hₜ – 1)) and t_c = round(v × (Wₜ – 1)), where Hₜ and Wₜ are the height and width of T. (Use standard rounding to the nearest integer index.)\n6. If the cell in T at (t_r, t_c) is 1 (blue), then set the output cell (r, c) to 1; if it is 2 (red), then ensure the output cell is 2. (Cells already having a 2 in the input must not be overwritten.)\n7. Leave all cells outside any lower group (and all parts of the reference group) unchanged.\n8. The result is that the lower groups have been filled with a scaled copy of the reference pattern: the red parts (2) remain at the same relative positions and any gaps are filled with blue (1) according to the proportional mapping of T onto each group’s bounding box.",

Copy each cell from the input grid into the corresponding cell (same row and column) of the output grid; note that the input pattern uses nonzero digits (for example 1, 2, 3, 6, etc.) to mark its colored pixels. 3. Observe that the input pattern forms a contiguous configuration of nonzero cells on a background of 0. The task is to extend (continue) that pattern into the extra rows (rows H through 9) so that the overall output remains a natural continuation of the input design and preserves the relative arrangement of the colored cells. 4. To extend the pattern, first determine the relative positions (row and column offsets) between connected nonzero cells in the input. Then, for each extra row (from row H up to row 9) identify which part of the input pattern would continue naturally – that is, for one or more groups of connected nonzero cells, compute the offset from one cell to its connected neighbor and apply the same offset to place a new cell into the extension area so that the relative layout is preserved. (For example, if a group in the input has a row in which three identical nonzero cells (such as 1’s) occur consecutively and in a later row the same group appears shifted to the right by a fixed number of columns, then in the output the extension is created by further shifting that group by the same amount.) 5. In every case the same nonzero value is used for the continuation (so if the input pattern was drawn in 1’s, extended cells are set to 1; if in 3’s or 2’s or 6’s, use that same number). 6. Only place a new colored cell when its computed (row, column) falls within the 10×10 bounds. 7.
