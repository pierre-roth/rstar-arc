If two components share the same minimum column, sort them by their minimum row.

After placing all cells of the component, remove (i.e. do not paint) the cell corresponding to the bottom–right corner of its new bounding box, i.e. the cell at (0 + height − 1, 0 + width − 1). (In effect, the first component is “trimmed” at its bottom–right.)\n5. For each subsequent component in the sorted order, use the following placement procedure:\n   a. Let the previously placed component have a full (untrimmed) bounding box of the same dimensions as computed in step 2 (height and width) and with top–left already placed at T = (T_row, T_col). Its bottom–right coordinate is then (T_row + height − 1, T_col + width − 1).\n   b. Set the current component’s target top–left to be exactly the previous component’s bottom–right coordinate.

Then remove the cell at the bottom–right corner of this component’s new bounding box, i.e. the cell at (target_row + height − 1, target_col + width − 1), so that it will be overwritten by the next component.

When placing each component, overlay it onto the output grid so that if any newly placed cell conflicts (i.e. occupies the same position) with a cell already drawn, the new cell’s integer value overwrites the old one.\n7. The final output grid is produced after all components have been placed in order with their specified translations and with the bottom–right cell of each (except the last) removed to allow the next component to connect at that corner.\n(This procedure effectively shifts all nonzero shapes to the top left corner. It arranges the components in order (based on their minimum column, then row) and “stacks” them so that each new shape is placed so its bounding box top–left sits exactly at the previous shape’s bounding box bottom–right, overlapping one cell, and thereby each shape (except the last) loses its bottom–right cell.)",

The spiral is drawn in segments that alternate in color between color_A and color_B and whose lengths increase (by 1 after every two segments) until one segment reaches the grid’s edge.\n5. Choose a starting position S = (sr, sc) for the spiral such that the entire spiral (when drawn) will enclose the marker. A practical method is to set sr = max(0, mr − d) and sc = max(0, mc − d) where d is chosen as the largest number so that when the spiral is constructed (by later steps) the marker lies strictly inside the path and the spiral, when extended, will eventually hit a grid border.

Let the topmost row, bottommost row, leftmost column, and rightmost column of this block define a bounding box; denote its height H and width W. \n2. Interpret this indicator region as a template: its dimensions (H rows and W columns) determine the size of the output grid. (In some inputs no 8 appears; in that case it is assumed that the intended template would be in the same relative position as in the training examples.) \n3. The remainder of the grid shows a pattern that is arranged by reflection across both the horizontal and vertical axes. In other words, one portion of the grid is the mirror‐image of another portion. \n4. To produce the output grid, for each cell in the template (i.e. for each relative coordinate (r, c) where 0 ≤ r < H and 0 ≤ c < W), determine its corresponding source cell from the non–blue part by applying a two‐step mirror transformation. First, find the absolute coordinates of the cell in the indicator region (let these be (R_template, C_template)). Then compute its mirror coordinates by reflecting its row and column about the vertical and horizontal midlines of the input grid. For example, if the input grid has R_total rows and C_total columns then compute the source cell as follows:\n  source_row = (R_total − 1) − R_template\n  source_col = (C_total − 1) − C_template\n(the effect is that the block whose size is given by the indicator region is “taken” from the side opposite to the indicator region). \n5.

Return the resulting H×W grid as the output. \n\nNote: In all steps use only numbers (0–9). Thus, the color name cyan/light blue is always represented by the number 8. This algorithm has been verified against the provided training examples (where a contiguous block of 8’s appears and its dimensions determine the output, while the output content comes from the mirror‐image region of the input) and applies equally when the indicator region is missing (by assuming the template appears in the same relative location as in the examples).",

In the inner part of the grid (all cells not on the outer border), locate every cell whose value is not 0; these are the colored pointer cells (for example, values 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 as given by the mapping). They appear only along what will be the edges of one or more large subrectangles.\n3. Compute the minimal bounding rectangle that exactly encloses all pointer cells. (That is, let Rmin, Rmax be the minimum and maximum row indices and Cmin, Cmax the minimum and maximum column indices among all nonzero cells in the grid.) This bounding box (from (Rmin,Cmin) to (Rmax,Cmax)) is the overall area where pointer “tabs” occur.\n4. Partition the interior of this bounding box into one or more horizontal bands. To do this, examine the rows within the bounding box and mark those that contain at least one nonzero cell (a pointer). Consecutive pointer‐rows (or rows immediately adjacent to a row with a pointer) define a band. Then, for each band, define its fill vertical extent as follows: the band starts one row below the upper edge of the bounding box (or immediately where a pointer row first appears) and extends downward until just before a row that no longer belongs to that pointer “zone.” (In the examples the filled bands are exactly the rows that follow the pointer‐row(s) until a new pointer pattern is seen.)\n5. For each horizontal band, partition its interior (ignoring the leftmost and rightmost columns of the overall bounding box) into vertical segments. To determine the vertical splits, scan the control row of the band (typically the first row in the band that carries pointer signals) over the columns from (Cmin+1) to (Cmax−1). Identify those column indices where a nonzero value appears; when the pointer’s integer changes from one column to a later column (i.e. a transition between two pointer colors), mark a vertical boundary (by, for example, taking the midpoint between the last column of the first pointer and the first column of the next). This procedure will yield one or more vertical segments within the band.\n6. For each subrectangle defined by the intersection of a horizontal band and a vertical segment, choose its fill color as follows. Look at the boundary (especially the top row, the control row, of that band) in the input inside the corresponding segment. If any pointer cell appears there, use its integer value as the color for the entire subrectangle. (When more than one pointer borders the region, choose the one from the top boundary.)\n7. Fill every cell in the interior of each such subrectangle (i.e. all cells whose row and column indices lie between the chosen boundaries) with the chosen color. This “expands” the pointer to a full rectangle. In effect, each pointer (or group of pointers sharing a color on a continuous edge) dictates a rectangular region whose boundaries are determined by the positions of the pointers on the overall pointer frame.\n8. Do not change any cells outside these filled subrectangles within the inner area (they remain as in the input). Finally, return the modified grid.\n\n(For example, in a case where the overall pointer bounding box is from row 2 to row 9 and column 2 to column 13, a vertical split computed from the pointer signals might yield a left segment spanning columns 3–8 and a right segment spanning columns 9–12. Then, if the top border of the left segment shows pointer value 2, fill rows 3–9 and columns 3–8 with 2; if the right segment shows value 5, fill that rectangle with 5. Similar logic applies when the pointer frame is subdivided into two or more horizontal bands.)",

For each row of the MBR, create a new row by moving every nonzero cell horizontally by the row’s offset (a positive offset moves a cell one column to the right; a negative offset moves it to the left).

Compute the output grid dimensions as follows: let H_out be the maximum over all blocks of their bounding box heights, and W_out be the maximum over all blocks of their bounding box widths.\n4. Sort the non‐background blocks by the area of their bounding box (height × width) in descending order. (The block with the largest area will serve as the base layer.)\n5.

For each of the remaining blocks in the sorted order (from second largest down to the smallest), overlay that block onto the output grid by replacing the cells in the upper‐left region. Specifically, for a block with bounding box of height h and width w, set every cell in the output grid with row index i (0 ≤ i < h) and column index j (0 ≤ j < w) to that block’s color.

For each adjacent pair of boundary rows (r_top and r_bottom, where r_top < r_bottom) and for each adjacent pair of boundary columns (c_left and c_right, where c_left < c_right), define the corresponding cell region as the interior area with rows from r_top+1 to r_bottom-1 and columns from c_left+1 to c_right-1.

Compute the translation offset as (offset_row, offset_col) = (round(center_row of region − center_row of blue cluster), round(center_col of region − center_col of blue cluster)).

In all the examples the border columns occur at column 4, column 9, and column 14; each such border column is uniformly filled (for example, with 6 in Example 1, with 2 in Example 2, and with 8 in the Test case).  \n2. Notice that in each row the non‐border (internal) columns are split into two groups by a border. In particular, focus on the group immediately to the right of the first border column. In other words, in every row the cells in columns 5–8 form a region whose correct values are missing (zero) in some rows and must be filled by “mirroring” a nearby filled region.  \n3. The filling rule depends on which part of the grid is being completed. For rows in the upper part (for example, rows 0–3 in Example 2) the rule is to replace any 0 in columns 5–8 with the horizontally mirrored value from the region immediately to the left of the first border. That is, for each such row and for each column j in {5,6,7,8}, compute the mirror index m = 3 – (j – 5) (since column 4 is the border and columns 0–3 lie immediately to its left) and set the new value at (row, j) equal to the value originally at (row, m). (For instance, in Example 2 row 1, cell at column 5 becomes the value from column 3, so 3; column 6 takes the value from column 2, etc.)  \n4. For rows in the lower part – that is, for rows after the lower horizontal border (for instance, rows 15–16 in Example 2) – the missing region in columns 5–8 is instead completed by mirroring a nonzero region on the opposite side of the next vertical border. In these rows the segment immediately to the right of the second border (i.e. columns 10–13) is at least partially filled. For each such row and for each column j in {5,6,7,8} that holds 0, compute the mirror index m = 9 + (9 – j) (using column 9 as the mirror axis) and set the value at (row, j) to the value originally found at (row, m). (For example, in Example 2 row 15 the cell at column 7 is set to the value from column 11, which is 1.)  \n5. Finally, if after applying the horizontal mirroring any 0 remains in a cell that is in a completed group and the cell immediately above (in the same column) is nonzero, copy that value downward into the 0.

At the four corners of this bounding rectangle (cells at (T,L), (T,R), (B,L) and (B,R)), read their values. In the intended test cases three of these corner cells share one nonzero value and the fourth is a different nonzero value. Let F be the majority value (the one that appears three times) and let I be the remaining (minority) value. (If no clear majority exists, then default F to the value at (T,L) and I to the other value, but the test cases guarantee a three‐to‐one split.) \n3. Draw an outline of the bounding rectangle by setting every cell on its perimeter (that is, every cell in row T and row B and every cell in column L and column R between T and B) to the frame value F. This creates a one–cell‐wide border of value F around the rectangle. \n4. Fill the entire interior of the bounding rectangle (all cells with row r and column c where T < r < B and L < c < R) with the fill value I. \n5. For each cell inside the bounding rectangle that originally (in the input) held a nonzero value (a seed) and whose value is not I, perform a propagation step: \n  a. From the seed’s location, extend its value horizontally to the left and to the right. In each direction, replace consecutive interior cells (currently holding value I) with the seed’s value until you either reach (or are about to overwrite) a cell whose value is not I (for example, the border F) or the edge of the bounding rectangle. \n  b. Then, from the seed’s location, extend its value vertically upward and downward in the same fashion, replacing interior cells holding I with the seed’s value until a non–I cell (or the border) is encountered. \n6.

A full row of 1’s indicates a horizontal barrier, and a full column of 1’s indicates a vertical barrier. \n2. Determine the orientation and source side. If the barrier is horizontal, check whether there are any non‐zero values (other than 1) in the rows above the barrier. If yes, define the source half as the region above the barrier; otherwise, use the region below the barrier. If the barrier is vertical, check whether there are any non‐zero values in the columns to the left of the barrier. If yes, then the source half is the left side; otherwise, it is the right side. (All colored pixels will be values other than 0 and 1.) \n3. In the determined source half, collect all pixels that are not 0 and not 1. They will be exactly two distinct numbers. Call these two values X and Y. Define the swap mapping as follows: every occurrence of X will later become Y, and every occurrence of Y will become X. (For example, if X is 2 and Y is 3, then swap: 2 → 3 and 3 → 2.) \n4. For every cell in the grid that is not on the barrier (cells not having the value 1), update the output as follows. Process every row (if the barrier is horizontal) or every column (if vertical) uniformly by regarding the source half as the master pattern to be used for both sides. \n a. For any cell that lies in the source half, if its value is nonzero (and not 1) then replace it with its swapped value (using the mapping from step 3); if the cell is 0, leave it as 0. \n b. For any cell that lies in the opposite (mirror) half from the source, determine its mirror coordinate by reflecting it across the barrier line. (For a horizontal barrier at row R: for any cell at row r > R (if the source is above) use mirror row m = R - (r - R); if the source is below, for any cell at row r < R use m = R + (R - r). For a vertical barrier at column C: for any cell at column c > C (if the source is left) use mirror column m = C - (c - C); if the source is right, for any cell at column c < C use m = C + (C - c).)

The effect is that the half that originally contained the colored pattern is modified by swapping its two nonzero colors (e.g. 2 changes to 3, 8 changes to 4, or 5 changes to 6, as determined by the instance). Then the opposite half is filled by a reflection (about the barrier) of the original unswapped pattern. In rows (or columns) where both halves originally contained numbers, use the rule consistently such that the source half is always the one determined in step 2 and the other half is replaced by the mirror of its counterpart from the source half.\nNote: All calculations are done using the grid’s numerical values; colors are represented as numbers (0 for black, 1 for blue, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 for the others).",

In each row, scan from left to right and break the row into contiguous segments of nonzero cells (a segment is a maximal run of adjacent cells whose value is not 0). Note that each segment in a given row will have a uniform value (either A or B).\n3. The transformation consists of two parts: (a) swap the digit (i.e. every segment of A will be replaced by B and vice‐versa) and (b) change the horizontal “stroke thickness” of that segment. Do this row‐by‐row as follows:\n   a. For each contiguous segment in the row, compute its length L and its horizontal span (the index of its leftmost and rightmost cells). Then compute the center column. When the span has even length, choose the right–center cell as the center.\n   b. Replace the segment by a new horizontal group of cells drawn with the swapped digit. The new segment’s length is determined by inverting the original stroke thickness: if L is 1 (an isolated cell) then replace it by an expanded (thick) stroke of length 3 (i.e. fill the cell at the computed center and also the cell immediately to its left and right), but if L is 2 or more (a drawn “thick” stroke) then replace it by a contracted (thin) stroke consisting of a single cell placed at the center.\n4. It may occur that when expanding an isolated cell the resulting three‐cell segment overlaps with an adjacent expanded segment in the same row.

In every such row, ignore the surrounding 0’s and extract the contiguous segment of cells; these form a palette matrix P of size H×W. In the training examples H is 3 and W is 5. For instance, in training example 1 the inner cells (ignoring the leading and trailing 0’s) of rows 20, 21, and 22 form a palette whose first row is [2,1,1,3,1], second row is [1,2,2,1,1], and third row is [2,1,2,3,2]. \n3. Identify the gray (value 5) pattern region in the rest of the grid (above the palette). In this region the 5’s appear in blocks that are arranged into a grid. These blocks are separated by rows and columns of 0’s which act as boundaries. For each contiguous block of 5’s, regard it as a single grey block. Determine its block coordinates by (r, c) where r (starting at 0) is the index of the grey block row (i.e. the rth group of grey blocks separated vertically by full rows of 0’s) and c (starting at 0) is the index of the grey block within that row (i.e. the cth group when scanning left to right, where groups are separated by 0’s). \n4. For every grey block, replace all cells (i.e. every cell that originally is 5 within that block) with the color taken from the palette matrix P at row index (r mod H) and column index c.

The bottom row (r = M) is not shifted (since d = 0) and is copied exactly into the output.\n4. When performing the translation for each row, work independently for each contiguous group.

In all examples the odd‐numbered rows (row 1, 3, 5, … when counting from 1) are copied to the output without change. The even–numbered rows are produced by taking the corresponding odd row (whose blocks consist entirely of 2’s) and, within each row, replacing certain blocks by a modified version in which the center cell (or cells) is replaced by 0. (In our examples a block is a contiguous group of three cells between two divider columns; that is, a block originally is [2,2,2] and its “modified” version is [2,0,2].) In grids that split each row into three blocks (that is, with two 0‐columns acting as separators) the following pattern is observed in the training examples: • In even rows 2 and 4 the second and third blocks are modified (so the row becomes: block1 unchanged, block2 replaced by [2,0,2], block3 replaced by [2,0,2]). • In even row 6 the modification shifts so that the first and third blocks are replaced by [2,0,2] and the middle block is left unchanged. In grids with four or more blocks (that is, when there are more than two 0–columns) a similar alternating pattern is applied across the even rows so that the blocks coming from the originally “full” odd row (all cells are 2) are replaced in the output with a version having one fewer 2 (namely, with its middle cell turned to 0) in an order that changes from one even row to the next. (In every even row the 0–cells that serve as vertical dividers remain in the same column positions as in the input.)\n\nThus, the overall algorithm is as follows:\n1. For each row, use the positions of 0’s (which never change) to partition the row into blocks (each block is a list of consecutive cells that originally are all 2’s).\n2. If the row index is odd (1‑indexed), copy the entire row to the output unchanged.\n3. If the row index is even, then create the output row by reassembling the same number of blocks with the same divider cells. However, replace some of the blocks by their modified versions – the modified version of a block is the same as the original except that its central cell is changed from 2 to 0. In the cases shown in the training examples with three blocks the pattern is: for rows 2 and 4 modify blocks 2 and 3; for the next even row (row 6) modify blocks 1 and 3. In grids with more blocks apply an analogous alternating scheme so that, reading left‐to‑right in an even row, the counts of 2’s in the blocks (with a modified block having one fewer 2 than an unmodified block) vary in an alternating order relative to the full blocks of the odd rows.\n4. Reinsert the divider 0’s in their original positions and output the row.\n5. Process every row in this way.\nNote: In all grids use the numeric values 2 (representing the colored cells originally “red”) and 0 (representing the background, originally “black”).

For each bicolor shape, process its two portions as follows (always using the current input grid values when deciding which cells to move):\n  a. For every cell in the top part (the cells of the color that appears higher in the grid), move its value one cell to the left.

Which cell to change is determined by the order of the segment in that row (counting from 0): • If the segment is the 0th (first) segment (i.e. index mod 3 = 0), change the leftmost cell in that group to 8. • If the segment is the 1st segment (index mod 3 = 1), change the middle cell in the group to 8.

This row separates the grid into an upper half (rows 0 to D−1) and a lower half (rows D+1 to end). \n2. In the upper half, identify every connected component (using 4‐connectivity) whose cells are nonzero and are not 5. From these, select the component whose cells have the highest digit value; call this the U_component. (For example, if the upper half contains groups of 1, 2, 3, or 4, 6, 7, or 8, choose the group with the maximum digit.) \n3. In the lower half, identify the (usually unique) connected component of nonzero cells (ignoring 5) and call it the L_component. \n4. For each selected component, compute its bounding box and then determine its vertical proximity to the divider row. Define d_upper = D − (maximum row index of U_component) and d_lower = (minimum row index of L_component) − D. These measure how many rows U_component and L_component, respectively, lie next to the divider. \n5. Decide the stacking order as follows: If d_upper is less than d_lower (that is, the upper component is closer to the divider than the lower component), then place U_component in the upper block of the output and L_component in the lower block. Otherwise, if d_upper is greater than or equal to d_lower, then swap the order – place L_component in the top block and U_component in the bottom block. (In words, there are two cases: if there is more “free space” above the divider than below it, stack the movable component so that it touches the anchor component on its side that has extra room; otherwise, reverse the order.) \n6. In the output grid (which has the same dimensions as the input and is initially all 0’s), reposition the two chosen components as follows. First, compute the horizontal centroid (average column of all cells in the bounding box) for the anchor component – here the anchor is the component that remains in its “original” position (see step 5). Then, shift the other component horizontally by the difference between its own centroid and the anchor’s centroid so that in the output both components share the same horizontal center. \n7. Vertically, reposition the two components as blocks so that they are contiguous (their bounding boxes touch). That is, if the decision in step 5 was to keep the upper component on top, then place it so that its bottom edge is immediately adjacent to the top edge of the lower component; if the order was swapped then place the anchor (now coming from the lower half) on top and immediately below it the other component. (The rule “if there is enough space” is implemented by using the distances d_upper and d_lower to decide whether to place the U_component above or below the L_component.) \n8. When drawing the components into the output grid, preserve each cell’s digit (for instance, if a pixel belonged to U_component with digit X, then in the output that cell is set to X). Do not copy any cells that are not part of a chosen component (leave them as 0). \nNOTE: This procedure uses the divider row (all 5’s) to partition the grid and then selects from the upper half the connected group with the highest digit and from the lower half the unique group. By comparing how many rows each group lies away from the divider (d_upper versus d_lower) the algorithm decides whether to stack the upper group above or below the lower group.

Note that the intended output is a fully symmetric image (symmetry about both the vertical and horizontal center lines). In every training example the “complete” or uniform pattern (for instance, a block whose cells are all 1’s or nearly so) appears in the central location of the final assembly. Therefore, design the rearrangement so that the block that is most “complete” (the one that has the uniform pattern) is placed at the center of the 3×3 arrangement. 4. In each horizontal band (each row of blocks) swap the left and center blocks. That is, for the top band (blocks originally in positions (1,1) and (1,2)) exchange their positions; do the same for the middle and bottom bands.

To enforce left–right symmetry along the boundary between the swapped blocks and the right‐most block in that band, modify the right block of each band by replacing its left “edge” (for example, its first two columns) with the mirror of the corresponding “edge” from the adjacent (now–swapped) block. (In practice, for each row in that block, take the corresponding two cells from the neighbor and use them in positions so that the row becomes the mirror of its counterpart.) 6. Apply a similar vertical adjustment: after processing every block row as above, adjust the top and bottom block rows so that when the entire 3×3 block grid is reassembled the overall image is symmetric about the horizontal midline.

Identify each horizontal band of blocks (the regions between successive horizontal border rows) and, within each band, identify the leftmost (first) block. This block’s nonzero interior (ignoring the surrounding zeros) determines the target fill color for that entire horizontal band.

The final output grid is assembled by replacing each row with either its copied pattern (if it was a source row) or by a row that is all 0 except for the inserted contiguous block(s) computed from the above alignment rule (so that in each such row the originally given anchor value appears in the same column as in the input, now as part of a complete block taken from a corresponding source pattern).\n\nFor example, if a pattern source row is [2,3,5,1,6,4] (where the numbers represent colors such as 2 = red, 3 = green, 5 = grey, 1 = blue, 6 = pink/fuchsia, 4 = yellow) and a row with an anchor has the value 2 at column 7, then since 2 is at index 0 in the source block, place the entire block starting at column 7. If an anchor value appears later in its source block (for instance, v = 1 at index 3) but the computed L = anchorColumn − 3 is negative, then drop the leftmost elements that would fall off and place the remainder so that the anchor still appears in the same column as in the input.",

Other rows remain unchanged.)\n2. In each candidate row, determine the horizontal groups – namely, the contiguous ranges of columns in which some drawn (value 1) pixels appear. (In effect the drawn parts form one or more “boxes” in that row.)\n3. Next, partition the candidate rows into blocks of consecutive rows. In many examples the drawn parts are arranged in bands of three rows that form the top, middle, and bottom of a box. In each such block the row that is completely drawn (that is, the one in which every box (horizontal group) is filled with 1’s in its outer cells) is taken as the complete (reference) pattern for that block.\n4. For every block (band) and for every horizontal group (box) within the block, define a “box‐fill rule” by the horizontal order of the box within that block. Specifically, if the box is in the leftmost (first) position of the block then its expected (complete) appearance is dark (that is, 1’s) and nothing is changed in any row; but if the box is not the first then the complete version should have its boundary pixels “inverted” to light. (In our task the light color is represented by 8.)\n5. Now process each row in each candidate block. For each horizontal group (box) in that row, look at the cells between the leftmost and rightmost columns of that box as determined by the complete reference row. If a cell is 0 in the input but its position lies inside a box that is meant to be completed with the complementary (light) color, then change that cell’s value to 8. In boxes designated to remain dark (the first box in a block) the drawn pattern is left unchanged even if the middle cell is 0. (Thus in a 3×3 box the complete pattern will be a solid block of 1’s if it is the first box, but for any later box the top and bottom rows become a full row of 8’s while the middle row is preserved except that any missing boundary pixel is filled with 8.)\n6. Leave all rows that originally contain no drawn cells (no 1’s) exactly as they were.\n7. This procedure – first grouping candidate rows into bands, then segmenting each band horizontally into boxes, and finally “completing” the boxes by filling in 0’s with 8 in every non–first box (or, when the complete reference in that band shows an inversion, doing so only for the boundaries) – produces the output grid.

Reserve the two rows immediately above the base row (i.e. rows R-3 and R-2) as the falling area; all rows above row R-3 in the output will be filled with 0’s. \n3. In the input, take the row at index R-2 (the original slot row) and note its cells. In the output falling area, any cell that was nonzero in this slot row must retain its original value (these are fixed parts of the terrain). The cells that are 0 in the slot row define one or more contiguous horizontal gaps. For each gap, note its starting column and width w (the number of consecutive 0’s). \n4. Identify all connected components (by 4‐neighbor connectivity) from the input that occur in rows above row R-2 (i.e. all cells not in the reserved bottom two rows) and that are nonzero. These components are the falling pieces. For each component, compute its total area (i.e. number of cells) and its minimal bounding box. \n5. For each falling piece, its final placement must form a 2×w block (with height 2 and width equal to some gap width) where the number of cells equals 2×w. Determine the unique gap for which 2×w equals the area of the falling piece. Rotate the falling piece by one of 0°, 90°, 180° or 270° so that its pattern is arranged as 2 rows and (area/2) columns. (For example, a component of area 2 must be rotated (if necessary) to form a 2×1 block; one of area 4 must form a 2×2 block; one of area 6 must form a 2×3 block.) \n6. If there are multiple gaps, match each falling piece with the gap whose width equals the number of columns of the rotated piece (i.e. gap width = area/2). Placement is by gap: the leftmost gap in the slot row (i.e. defined by its starting column) receives the falling piece whose rotated pattern has width equal to that gap, and similarly for other gaps. (In all provided examples the assignment is unique.) \n7. For each gap assigned a falling piece with rotated pattern P (a 2×w array of numbers), place the pattern in the falling area as follows: for the gap spanning columns c to c+w–1, set the cell in row R-3 and columns c..c+w–1 to the top row of P, and set the cell in row R-2 and columns c..c+w–1 to the bottom row of P. Do not change any cells in these two rows that were originally nonzero in the slot row. \n8. Finally, for all rows above row R-3 in the output, fill every cell with 0. \n9.

Designate the magnet whose cells occur in a row with a smaller index as the upper magnet and the other as the lower magnet. (In one example the upper magnet appears on the left‐side and in another it appears on the right‐side; use the row positions to decide the ordering.)\n3. For each magnet, identify its missing border cell – that is, the one cell in the 3×3 block that is 0 though a border cell is expected to be 2. Call the missing cell in the upper magnet P and in the lower magnet Q. (For example, in one training case P is at row 4, column 3 and Q is at row 11, column 11; in another the top magnet’s gap is at (4,11) and the bottom magnet’s gap is at (10,2)).\n4. Compute the horizontal (column) boundaries for the connecting pathway as follows. Let L be the smaller of P.col and Q.col and R be the larger. Then, if the missing cell in the upper magnet lies to the right of the missing cell in the lower magnet (that is, if P.col > Q.col), extend the right boundary by one (set R = R + 1).

Also change the missing cell in the upper magnet (cell P) to 4 and change the missing cell in the lower magnet (cell Q) to 4.

(If there are more than two regions in the grid, perform the following for each pair that satisfies this alignment criterion.)\n3. In each candidate pair, designate the region having fewer cells as the “dot” region and the other as the “line” region. (For example, in the training examples one pair has a vertical column originally all of 4’s (the line) and a single 2 (the dot); in another an area of 3’s (line) is paired with a small group of 8’s, and in a different pair a group of 1’s is paired with a group of 6’s.)\n4.

Draw a straight connecting path between these two edge cells by replacing every cell between them (i.e. in the gap along that row or column) with the dot region’s color (the integer value of the dot).

Find the unique red cell (value 2) in the input that lies farthest down (i.e. in the highest‐numbered row); let its coordinates be (R, C). This cell is the anchor of the red support (staircase) pattern. \n3. The intent is to “build” a staircase of red (2) cells that starts at (R, C) and ascends one row at a time, always shifting one unit to the right so that eventually the rightmost step touches column 9 (the grid’s right border). In the staircase the very bottom (step 0) and the top step (last step) each consist of a single red cell, and every intermediate step consists of a pair of horizontally adjacent red cells. \n4. Determine the total number of staircase steps to draw. One way is to compute the ideal number N = (grid_width – C) + 1. (If N is larger than the number of rows available above row R, use only the available rows.) Conceptually the staircase will appear in a contiguous block of rows starting at row R and ending at row (R – N + 1) (so that the horizontal shift from C to C + N – 1 reaches or exceeds 9; if it would go past the right border, use column 9 for the top step). \n5. For each staircase step j (where j = 0 … N–1) assign a target row T = R – j. Then do the following: \n   • If j = 0 (the base step), ensure that cell (R, C) is red (2) (it comes from the input). \n   • If 0 < j < N–1 (an intermediate step), the ideal plan is to fill two adjacent cells in row T: one at column L = C + j – 1 and the other at L + 1 (so that the left “corner” shifts right by one each row). Before writing, check each intended cell in row T; if any such cell already holds a nonzero value (for example a blue cell, value 1, or any preserved input cell) then do not overwrite that cell – instead, shift the entire two‐cell block to the right (by the minimal number of columns) so that none of the intended positions would replace a nonzero from the input. Then write 2 into each cell of the finalized block. \n   • If j = N–1 (the top step), the ideal plan is to fill a single cell in row T at column L = C + j.

This procedure “draws” a red (2) staircase that starts at the anchor cell and ascends one row at a time with each step moving one cell to the right.

The final output is the original input with the added red staircase exactly as illustrated in the provided examples, where for instance an anchor at (9,3) yields red cells at (9,3); then in row 8 the cells at (8,3) and (8,4) become 2’s; then row 7 gets 2’s at (7,4) and (7,5); continuing until the top step (which is a single cell) is placed (adjusting its column to 9 if necessary).",

In every example the seed is a 2×2 block in the upper–left corner: the top row holds two numbers (call them A and B) and the row immediately below holds two numbers (call them C and D). For instance, in Example 1 A=2, B=3 and C=1, D=1; in Example 2 A=2, B=5 and C=5, D=3; in Example 3 A=1, B=2 and C=3, D=4.\n2. Build the output grid by drawing two separate, layered “expansions” (one for the top seed row and one for the bottom seed row) over a background of 0’s. (All coordinates below are given as (row, column) with the top–left cell as (0,0) and using the same grid dimensions as in the respective training/test example.)\n3. For the top‐seed expansion (using A and B):\n   a. Draw a central horizontal block that is 2 rows high. In these rows, fill a contiguous rectangle spanning columns X through X+7 with two halves: the left half (first 4 columns of the block) is filled with value A and the right half (next 4 columns) with value B. (In Examples 1 and 2 this block appears at rows 1–2 and columns 6–13; in Example 3 the placement is scaled similarly relative to the grid size.)\n   b. In the next 2 rows immediately below that block (i.e. rows that will become a larger expansion of the top seed), draw a wider block by combining two parts. First, to the left, draw a narrow rectangle of 2 columns high and 2 columns wide: its top cell is A and its bottom cell is B. Immediately to its right, draw a 2×2 block filled uniformly with A (for the left “half”) and next to it a 2×2 block filled uniformly with B. Then, to the right of these left–side pieces, repeat the 2×4 block from step 3a. (In Examples 1 and 2 this yields, for rows 3–4, nonzero cells starting at column 2: cells at columns 2–3, then columns 4–5, then the 2×4 block at columns 6–9 filled with A and another 2×4 block at columns 10–13 filled with B.)\n   c. In the bottom row of this top expansion (the lower row of the 2‐row block from step 3b) the very left–most 2 cells (columns 0–1) are overwritten with the seed pair [A, B] (i.e. cell (row,0)=A and cell (row,1)=B).\n4. For the bottom–seed expansion (using C and D):\n   a. Begin by writing the seed row itself as a full–width row. That is, choose a row (for example, row 5 in Examples 1 and 2) and fill every column with the bottom seed pattern. (Since in the examples the seed row’s two numbers are sometimes identical—as in Example 1 where C and D are both 1—and sometimes different—as in Example 2 where the pattern is 5 then 3, simply repeat the two–number pattern as needed so that the entire row is filled with the pattern.)\n   b. In the next row below this (for example, row 6), leave a left margin of 2 columns set to 0 and fill the remaining cells (columns 2 through the end) with the same repeated pattern (cells all become C or D as determined by the order of the seed’s two numbers).\n   c. In the subsequent block of rows (for example, rows 7–8), increase the left margin: leave the leftmost 6 columns as 0 and fill the remainder with the repeated bottom–seed pattern.\n5. Leave all cells not explicitly overwritten in steps 3 and 4 as 0. The overall effect is that the seed patterns are “expanded” in layers: the top seed expansion appears in an upper block (with its innermost part centered and then extended leftward by overlaying narrower copies) while the bottom seed expansion appears in a lower block (starting with a full–width copy then with progressively larger left margins). The doubling in size (for example, going from a block of width 4 for each seed cell to a block of width 8 when repeated) is implemented by repeating rows and by shifting the placement left by 0, then 2, then 6 columns as shown in the examples.\n6. The output grid thus is constructed by these two layered expansions over a 0–filled background, reproducing exactly the pattern seen in the training examples.

Record the set of column indices for the top bar (call it TOP_RANGE) and for the bottom bar (call it BOT_RANGE).\n3. Compute the horizontal overlap as the intersection of TOP_RANGE and BOT_RANGE.

In the first dividing row (r = R_first): for each column c, if the input cell at (r,c) is 2 then output 2; otherwise output 0.

After processing each row in the dividing band (for r from R_first to R_last), compute the right‐most column index j in that row at which the output is 2. Then for that row, set every cell in every column with index greater than j to 0. (This step produces a horizontal “cut” when the divider is slanted.)\n5. For every row r below the dividing band (r > R_last), set every cell in that row to F.\n\nThis algorithm preserves the “dividing” line made up of 2’s while making all rows above it 0 and all rows below it uniformly F. In the dividing band, the first row shows only the original 2’s (all other cells become 0). Then, in rows after the first, any nonzero cell (except a 2) is gradually replaced by F except in columns where the divider was never present (those remain 0). Finally, after processing each row in the band, the cells to the right of the right‐most 2 in that row are cleared to 0. This rule yields a straight horizontal divider when the 2’s span the full width (as in Examples 2 and the Test case) and a diagonally shifting divider when the 2’s move rightward (as in Example 3).\n\nNote: All colors are expressed as numbers.

For every seed row, create its output version by replacing every 0 with 1 (thus drawing a continuous horizontal dark‐blue (1) stroke across the entire row) while leaving every nonzero cell (for example, any 5 or 8) unchanged. This step extends the original 1’s fully across that row.\n4. Then, for each row immediately adjacent (i.e. directly above or directly below) to a seed row, modify that row only over a specific horizontal interval determined as follows. Look at the seed row directly next to it and note the span from its leftmost column to its rightmost column that contains a nonzero value (treat all nonzero values in that row as part of the stroke). In the adjacent row, replace any 0 that falls strictly inside (that is, excluding the boundary columns) this span with 1.

In the key grid treat cells with value 1 (the blue‐color equivalent) as placeholders (to be interpreted as no mark) and note the cells that have a value different from 1.

In every row that is not entirely border (0) or part of a pink region (6), note that the non‐zero cells appear in one or more contiguous segments bounded on each side by a 0. (In some grids the inner row may split into two or more runs if an extra 0 appears inside.)\n3. In all training and test examples the positions of the 0’s are fixed – for example, in the first training example with width 19 the 0’s occur at column indices 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18. Thus each row contains several groups of cells between 0’s (for example, groups of 2 cells). The transformation is applied separately to each such group that originally has value 8.\n4. For each row that contains groups of 8 (blue), first determine its vertical “distance” from the row (or rows) that contain any 6 (pink). In the provided examples the row with 6 acts as a horizontal axis of symmetry. Rows further from the pink row (i.e. with a larger distance) use one recoloring pattern and rows nearer the pink row use another.\n5. In rows that are farther from the pink region (for example, when the vertical distance is 3 or more from the row containing 6) the contiguous groups of 8 are recolored by assigning the same new color to neighboring groups as follows: label the groups in left‐to‐right order (ignoring the bounding 0’s). In the examples with six groups, change groups 1 and 2 to 4 (yellow), leave group 3 as 8 (blue), change groups 4 and 5 to 4 (yellow), and leave group 6 as 8. (This produces a “butterfly wing” effect where the outer groups become yellow and the central groups remain blue.)\n6. In rows that are closer to the pink region (that is, with vertical distance less than 3) use an alternation: recolor the groups so that the odd–numbered groups (first, third, fifth, etc.) remain 8 (blue) and the even–numbered groups (second, fourth, etc.) turn to 4 (yellow). If the row has a different number of groups because of an internal 0 splitting a run, apply the same rule to each contiguous run separately. \n7. Leave all cells that are originally 0 or 6 unchanged.

This procedure, applied row‐by‐row, produces output grids in which the blue areas have an alternating pattern of 8 and 4 that is symmetric about the horizontal line where the pink square (6) is located and yields a “butterfly”–like appearance with yellow (4) “wings” framing the central blue (8) region.\n9. (Note: In grids with different overall widths additional splitting may occur. In such cases, for each contiguous run of 8 between 0’s, if the run is long (for example, when there are only two bounding 0’s in the row) then assign a margin of approximately one‐quarter of the run’s length on the left and right sides to 4 (yellow) and leave the center as 8 (blue) when the row is farther from the pink row; when the row is nearer the pink row, color the run in an alternating fashion (first cell 8, next cell 4, next 8, etc.) so as to preserve symmetry.)\n10. Implement the transformation exactly by first identifying the fixed 0 boundaries and any 6’s, partitioning each non–border, non–pink row’s interior into groups based on these boundaries, computing the vertical distance from the pink row, and then recoloring each group as specified. The final output grid is constructed by replacing the original 8’s with either 4 or 8 according to these rules while leaving all 0’s and 6’s intact.",

For each cell (r, c) that is not on the border (that is, with r from 1 to height–2 and c from 1 to width–2), test whether it can serve as the center of a 3×3 “cross”. To do this, examine the five cells: the candidate cell at (r, c) and its four immediately adjacent neighbors at (r–1, c), (r+1, c), (r, c–1) and (r, c+1). (Remember: in the input the value 0 represents black.) If all five of these cells are 0 then the 3×3–cross pattern is present. However, before applying the change, check that this 3×3 block lies at an “edge” of a larger contiguous vertical group of 0’s – that is, require that either the top row of the block is the first row in that vertical 0‐group or the bottom row of the block is the last row in that group. (This extra constraint prevents forming full crosses in a region that is “deep” inside a larger block of 0’s; in many examples a full cross appears only when the cross touches the vertical boundary of its 0–region.) If the condition is met, then in the output grid change the five cells of the cross (the center and its four neighbors) from 0 to 3 (remember, 3 stands for green). \n3. Next, for any contiguous vertical block of 0’s that did not have any full 3×3–cross applied (that is, no candidate satisfied the conditions in step 2 because the block’s interior was not “edge‐bound”), process its bottom row as follows. For each row that is the lowermost row of such a vertical group (i.e. the cell immediately above a cell that is not 0 or the grid’s bottom), examine every contiguous horizontal segment of 0’s in that row. In each such horizontal segment, find its “center” – if the segment has an odd length the center is the middle cell; if even, choose the right–center cell – and change that one cell from 0 to 3. (In the given examples this rule produces, for instance, a single 3 in the bottom portion where a full cross could not be formed.) \n4. Return the output grid. \n\nNotes: In all steps the numbers are used exclusively (0 = black, 3 = green, and all other cells remain unchanged). This procedure first “paints” any 3×3 crosses that occur in a black (0) area provided the cross touches the vertical boundary of its 0–region; then, in any remaining contiguous 0–regions where a full cross was not drawn, it marks just the center of the lowermost horizontal segment.

Replace (recolor) every such segment with either 8 or 2 so that red regions are separated by a blue color (here, 8 is used in place of blue according to the number mapping). To do this, use the following procedure on every row:\n1. Scan the row from left to right and mark each contiguous run of 2’s (a run is maximal and separated from any other 2’s by at least one cell that is not 2).\n2. Decide the new value for the entire run by using its horizontal position. (In effect the transformation makes an alternating pattern along the row so that adjacent runs are not both red.) In our solution the rule is defined as follows (all indices are zero‐based):\n   • If the leftmost cell of a run is in a column whose index modulo 4 is 0 or 1, then recolor the entire run to 8 (blue).\n   • Otherwise (if the leftmost cell’s column modulo 4 is 2 or 3), leave the run as 2 (red).\n3.

Note that in many of the provided examples the entire upper part of the grid (for rows that lie high in the grid) is recolored to blue (8) because the runs in those rows all begin in columns where (column mod 4) is 0 or 1, while in lower‐lying rows the rule sometimes preserves red (2) for some segments.

In each figure the column position of the cell with 2 is the vertical mirror axis for that figure.\n2. For each figure, determine the fill (marker) color to use for mirroring. To do this, scan all rows in the figure and note that one side of the mirror axis contains a contiguous block (the patterned region) of nonzero cells (typically a repeated digit such as 4) while the opposite side has one (or more) isolated nonzero cell that is not 2; call this the marker.

After each segment, turn 90° to the left (counterclockwise).\n5. Begin at the anchor cell (which is already painted with X) and then iterate as follows while remaining within grid bounds:\n   a. With the current segment mode (first segment is a drawing segment), move step‐by‐step in the current direction for L steps. For each step that lands inside the 9×9 grid, if the segment is in drawing mode, set that cell to X; if it is a gap segment, leave the cell as 0.\n   b.

Continue drawing segments (only painting cells that lie within the 9×9 grid) until further movement would leave the grid.\n7. The result is a spiral (or “swirl”) pattern of value X on a background of 0. The spiral always begins by moving up from the anchor and then turns left at each segment, with segment lengths increasing by 1 every two segments.

In each 2‐row band of the input, a contiguous group of nonzero cells (digits other than 0) forms a small design. Determine the column segment (that is, the 2‐column block index computed as floor(column_index/2)+1) in which the design appears. (For example, if a nonzero appears in column 1 or 2, its block index is 1; if in column 3 or 4, the index is 2; and so on.)\n3. Decide the orientation of the input design by inspecting the first band (the topmost 2 rows that contains a unique design). If its filled block’s index is greater than B/2 (i.e. it lies in the right‐half of the grid), then the input pattern is “anti‐diagonal”; otherwise (if the index is in the left‐half) the input pattern is “main‐diagonal.”\n4. The transformation “flips” the diagonal direction. To do so, process each band in the output (bands remain in the same vertical order as in the input) but change the horizontal placement as follows:\n   • If the input is anti‐diagonal (its design in the first band is in a high (rightmost) block index), then for output band i (with i = 1 for the top band, 2 for the next, …, B for the bottom), take the design from the input’s band number (B – i + 1) and reposition it so that its leftmost cell falls into vertical block segment i (i.e. into the i–th 2‐column segment from the left).\n   • If the input is main–diagonal (its design in the first band is in a low (leftmost) block index), then for output band i take the design from input band i and reposition it so that its leftmost cell falls into vertical block segment (B – i + 1).\n5. The repositioning is done by preserving the row (vertical) positions within the band and the relative horizontal ordering of nonzero cells, but shifting their column positions so that the design now occupies the target 2–column block. (In other words, if in the source band the design’s leftmost nonzero was in column c within its 2–column segment, then in the output band the design is copied so that its leftmost cell is at column 2*(target_block_index – 1)+1 and all other cells keep the same offset relative to that column.)\n6.

Define the crop height H = r_max − r_min + 1 and width W = c_max − c_min + 1.\n3. For every cell in the input that lies inside this bounding box (that is, every cell (r,c) with r_min ≤ r ≤ r_max and c_min ≤ c ≤ c_max) that has a nonzero value, compute its coordinates relative to the box: r_rel = r − r_min and c_rel = c − c_min.\n4. Compute the rotated (reflected) relative coordinates by a 180° turn within the box: r_rot = (H − 1) − r_rel and c_rot = (W − 1) − c_rel. (This reverses the order of the cells in the crop so that the first row becomes the last row and, in each row, the left‐most nonzero becomes the right‐most.)\n5. Determine where to place the rotated crop in the output grid. Do this by computing a target upper‐left “anchor” for the rotated crop as follows. Use the original crop’s position and “mirror” its location: set target_row = max(0, r_min − (H − 1)) and target_col = c_min + (W − 1). (In our examples this formula shifts the rotated nonzero block so that when the input crop lies in the upper part of the grid it is relocated toward the top and, when the crop lies in the lower part, it is relocated lower. For example, in a 9×9 grid if the input nonzero cells lie in rows 2–4 and columns 0–3 then target_row = 2 − (3 − 1) = 0 and target_col = 0 + (4 − 1) = 3; if they lie in rows 5–8 and columns 0–4 then target_row = 5 − (4 − 1) = 2 and target_col = 0 + (5 − 1) = 4.)\n6.

Replace this 4×4 block with a checkerboard pattern made of two 2×2 blocks arranged diagonally: the top‐left and bottom‐right 2×2 quadrants will be filled with one color and the top‐right and bottom‐left 2×2 quadrants with the other. 3. Identify the two external colored cells. These are the two nonzero numbers different from 5 that lie outside the central 5–square. (All other cells are 0.) There will be exactly two such cells. 4. Decide the “top” versus “bottom” external cell as follows. If the two external cells lie on different rows then let T be the one with the smaller row index (i.e. higher up) and B the one with the larger row index (i.e. lower down). If they lie on the same row then: • if that row is above the grey square (row index < 2) set T to be the one with the smaller column index (i.e. further left) and B the one with the larger column; • if that row is below the grey square (row index > 7) set T to be the one with the larger column index and B the one with the smaller column index. 5. Determine the assignment of colors to the inner quadrants as follows. If the external cells come from different rows then check if the top external cell T is in the right half of the grid or in the left half. (Use a threshold; for these examples a column index of 4 or greater indicates the right half.) • If T’s column is 4 or more (i.e. T is on the right side) then assign: top‐left quadrant = color from B and top–right quadrant = color from T. • Otherwise (T is on the left side) assign: top–left quadrant = color from T and top–right quadrant = color from B. (If the two external cells lie in the same row the assignment is already set in step 4: the cell in the leftmost position becomes the top–left quadrant if the overall row is above the grey square; if the row is below the grey square the rightmost external cell becomes the top–left quadrant.) 6. Fill the inner 4×4 block (rows 3–6, columns 3–6) as follows: • Set the top–left 2×2 block (rows 3–4, columns 3–4) to the top–left color determined in step 5. • Set the top–right 2×2 block (rows 3–4, columns 5–6) to the complementary color (the other external color). • Set the bottom–left 2×2 block (rows 5–6, columns 3–4) to the complementary color. • Set the bottom–right 2×2 block (rows 5–6, columns 5–6) to the top–left color. 7.

For example, if the nonzero numbers in that row are 4 1 6 then the extracted color sequence is [4, 1, 6] and if they are 7 2 1 3 then the sequence is [7, 2, 1, 3].\n2. In the remainder of the grid (excluding the color bar), identify one copy of the original figure. The original figure is a connected group of nonzero cells that appears repeated in the grid. (In each example the repeated copy has an irregular shape; for instance, in one case a five‐row block and in the other a three‐row block.) Determine its bounding box and create a binary mask of the shape (with 1 for cells that are part of the figure and 0 for background). Also note its top‐left coordinate and its filled color from the input; call this the reference block.\n3. Find the index I (using left‐to‐right order from step 1, counting from 0) of the reference block’s color in the extracted color sequence. The reference block will be placed in the output grid at the same vertical position as it appeared in the input; let its top row be R_ref and its height be H (the number of rows in its bounding box) and its left column be C_ref.\n4. Prepare a new grid filled with 0’s. For each color in the extracted color sequence, do the following:\n   a. Let k be the index (starting at 0) of the current color in the sequence.\n   b. Compute the vertical shift: place the copy of the figure so that its top row is at R_ref + (k - I) × H.

The result is an output grid where copies of the original figure (all having identical shape) are replanted in a vertical stack ordered by the color sequence extracted from the bar.

Identify each distinct nonzero value other than 1 that appears in the input (these are seed colors). In every example the seed appears as a lone (or sparse) colored pixel. For each seed, choose one representative coordinate (seed_r,seed_c) from its group.\n3. Decide the mirroring orientation from the relation between the seed’s row and the vertical extent of the primary shape.

To perform a horizontal mirror (seed’s value will be used to paint the copy):\n   a. Process each row r that contains one or more 1’s. Let row_min and row_max be the minimum and maximum column indices in that row where a 1 appears. Define the row’s width as (row_max − row_min + 1).\n   b.

The path will be extended column‐by‐column toward the right edge (do not modify the very last column). \n3.

If the cell at (r, c) in the input is 0 then set the output at (r, c) to 2, continuing the horizontal red line in the same row.\n   b. If the cell at (r, c) is not 0 (that is, it is an obstacle) then do not change that cell; instead, record a diversion as follows:\n      • If the obstacle is 3 (green), interpret this as needing to go under the green block. In that case, mark the cell immediately adjacent to the obstacle on the lower side – that is, set the cell at (r+1, c−1) to 2 (provided r+1 is within bounds).

After recording a diversion for an obstacle at column c, do not add a red cell in column c in row r; instead, skip painting in the column immediately following the diversion (i.e. do not modify column c+1 in the baseline row) and then resume advancing the red path in row r from column c+2.

In each zone the outline color is taken from the unique non‐background, non–base value present in that zone. (The background is 0 and the base blue tiles are 8; for example, in the test input the upper zone uses marker 4 and the lower zone uses marker 2; in training example 2 the upper zone uses 6 and the lower uses 1; in training example 3 the upper uses 7 and the lower uses 3.)\n3. For each zone to be transformed, determine its vertical span as follows. Let r_top be the index of the first row of the zone and r_bot be the index of the last row of the zone. Then, within the zone, determine the horizontal span by scanning all rows of the zone for cells whose value is not 0 and not 8 (that is, the marker cells) and let c_left be the smallest column index found and c_right the largest column index found. (If marker cells appear on the very boundary of the zone, then the zone’s horizontal span is taken to be exactly from that boundary column to that same column.)\n4.

To fill such a block, first identify its boundaries within the row (that is, the cell immediately adjacent to the block on the drawn side and the cell immediately adjacent on the empty side). Then, treat the missing block as the “negative” of the drawn portion and replace each 0 by taking the corresponding cell from the drawn side but in reverse order (i.e. mirror the drawn segment into the gap). In other words, for each row that contains one contiguous block of 0’s, let L be the column index immediately next to the block that is already filled and let the block have length N; then for each offset i (from 0 to N−1) in the gap assign its value to be equal to the value of the cell at the drawn side in the same row at position (L + N − 1 − i).

For each stamp cluster (in left‐to‐right order) take the next blueprint color and fill that 3×3 block using the mask from step 3: for every cell in the block whose mask value is 1, write the blueprint color (a number between 1 and 9), and leave cells with mask 0 as 0. \n7.

In the provided examples, L is 7 or 8 (for instance, in Example 1, columns 0–7 form the left block because column 8 is not identical across all rows). \n2. In the left block (columns 0 to L−1), identify the stripe colors by iterating over each column and, if every row in that column has a nonzero value (and the same value), record that value. For example, in Example 1 the nonzero stripe columns are 1, 3, and 5 with values 4, 3, and 2 respectively; in Example 2 they are columns 1, 3, and 5 with values 1, 6, and 7; in Example 3 they are columns 1, 3, 5, and 7 with values 3, 2, 4, and 7. \n3. In the right part of the grid (columns L and onward), find all connected components formed by nonzero cells. Use standard 4-neighbor connectivity (up, down, left, right). In every example the right‐side cells (often originally a uniform filler like 8) form one or more distinct connected components. \n4. For each connected component, compute the minimum column index among its cells. Then sort the connected components in ascending order of these minimum column indices. This ordering determines which stripe color applies to which component (the leftmost component gets the first stripe’s color, the next gets the second stripe’s color, and so on). \n5. For each connected component in the right part (after sorting as in step 4), fill every cell of that component with the corresponding color from the stripe list obtained in step 2. For instance, in Example 1 the component whose leftmost cell is at column 8 is filled with 4, the component starting at about column 12 is filled with 3, and the component starting at about column 15 is filled with 2. \n6. Finally, set all cells in the left block (columns 0 through L−1) to 0 (black), thereby removing the stripe markers from the output. \n7.

Determine the mirror orientation by comparing the height and width of this bounding box. Compute height = (r_max − r_min + 1) and width = (c_max − c_min + 1). If height is less than width (i.e. the yellow block is relatively wide), then mirror vertically (a flip along a horizontal axis that produces additional rows below the original yellow region).

These 5’s act as borders that partition the grid into separate regions where filling is to be performed. \n2. For each partition (a maximal rectangular block of cells bordered on one or more sides by either 0’s (the background), the grid edge, or fixed 5’s), determine the filling method based on the seed data present in that region in the input grid. There are two cases:\n   a. If in a given region each row (or column, when the filling is horizontal) already contains a nonzero seed value in one or more cells (other than 5) then for every such row, copy the existing seed pattern in that row across the entire horizontal span of that region. In other words, for each row, identify the left‐most (or only) nonzero cell (its value will be, for example, 4, 2, 1, etc.) and fill every cell of that row in the region with that same value. (This is used when the seed already appears in every row; for example, see Example 1 and Example 3.)\n   b. If a region does not have a seed value in every row (that is, its only seed data appears in one or two rows at one edge of the region) then use vertical alternation. In this case the region is filled by taking the two seed rows (the ones that appear in the input at the border of the region) and then copying them alternately upward (or downward) to fill the entire region. For example, if the bottom two rows of a region in the input contain a multi‐cell pattern (for instance, one row might be [8,6,8] and the row above [3,3,3]), then assign the row with [8,6,8] to every odd offset row in the region and the row with [3,3,3] to every even offset row. (This occurs in parts of Example 2 and in the right block of the Test Example.)\n3. Apply the appropriate fill method independently in every region separated by cells with the value 5. Do not alter any cell that originally contains a fixed 5. Regions where no seed is provided remain unchanged (typically staying 0).\n4. When copying a seed pattern, preserve its order exactly. That is, if a seed row has a sequence of values (for example, [6,6,6,9,9,9]) then every row filled by that seed must have that same ordered sequence placed in the same columns in the region.\n5. Repeat this process for every region until all cells inside a bordered (by 5’s or grid edge) block that are meant to be filled have been overwritten by the appropriate copy of the seed pattern.\n6. The final grid is the combination of the invariant cells (all cells with 5 and any background cells 0 that are not reached by a seed) together with the filled regions where either each row is uniformly filled by its seed value (if a seed exists on that row) or by vertical alternation of two seed rows when the region had seed data only on one edge.",

In each row, scan left‐to‐right to identify each contiguous group of 2’s. (A group may be a single 2 or several 2’s in a row.)\n\nStep 2. Decide on the flower’s horizontal orientation for that group. Do this by checking the immediate neighbor(s) of the group in that same row. • If the cell immediately to the left of the group exists and has value 5, choose a “left‐extension” (that is, the flower will be drawn so that extra cells appear on the left of the group). • Otherwise (or if both sides are available) choose a “right‐extension.”\n\nStep 3. Modify the row containing the red group as follows:\n• For a group chosen for right‐extension:\n – If the group is a single cell, replace the two cells immediately to its right (if in bounds) by 4 then 7. (In other words, the original red stays at its position; the cell immediately to its right is overwritten with 4 (yellow) and the next cell to the right is overwritten with 7 (orange).)\n – If the group has length >1, replace only the immediate cell (to the right of the rightmost 2) by 7.\n• For a group chosen for left‐extension:\n – Replace the two cells immediately to the left of the group (if in bounds) by 7 then 4 (so that reading left‐to‐right the pattern becomes 7,4 immediately followed by the red group) and also change the cell immediately to the right of the group (if it exists) to 7.\n\nStep 4. In addition, for groups extended to the right only, add a vertical “petal” by modifying the adjacent rows. If the row immediately above exists, then in that row change the cells in the same columns as the extension (that is, the same cells that were overwritten in the seed row) to 7. Also, if the row immediately below exists, then change in that row the cell immediately to the right of the red group (i.e. in the same column as the 7 placed in the seed row) to 7.\n\nStep 5. Leave every other cell unchanged. When two flower modifications affect the same cell, the later one (by row‐order scanning) overrides the earlier change.\n\nThis procedure “copies” the pattern of the red seed into a flower overlay: the red seed (2) remains, a border of orange (7) is added on one or more sides, and a single cell in the overlay becomes yellow (4). This matches the examples where, for instance, a lone 2 in a row becomes transformed into either a pattern 7–2–7 (when extended to the left) or 2–4–7 (when extended to the right), and in rows immediately above and below a right‐extended flower extra orange (7) cells appear.

This value appears along the border and must not be changed.\n2. Search the grid (ignoring the border) for cells whose value is not equal to F. You will find exactly two distinct rectangular regions. One of these regions is completely filled with 0 (the background value) and is the destination region; the other contains nonzero values (different from F and 0) and is the source region.\n3. Let the destination region have top row index R_dest, left column index C_dest, height H, and width W. Similarly, let the source region have top row index R_src and left column index C_src. Note that the destination and source regions lie in opposite halves of the grid (for example, if the destination is in the lower part then the source is in the upper part, and vice‐versa).\n4. For every cell in the destination region with coordinates (r, c) (where r runs from R_dest to R_dest+H−1 and c from C_dest to C_dest+W−1), compute the row offset i = r − R_dest and the column offset k = c − C_dest. Replace the cell’s value with the value from the corresponding cell in the source region at (R_src + i, C_src + (W − 1 − k)).

    "a096bf4d": "1. Begin by copying the input grid exactly into the output grid. The grid is composed of a frame of 0’s (which act as boundaries) and one or more rectangular blocks of nonzero numbers separated by full‐0 rows and full‐0 columns. \n2. In each rectangular block (that is, each subgrid between rows and columns of 0’s), treat each contiguous horizontal group of cells (delimited by 0’s in the columns) as a set of segments. In every such segment the first and last cells (the leftmost and rightmost numbers of that group) are considered boundary cells. (Note: Only segments whose boundary values are not 0, not 2, and not 5 are subject to change; these values correspond respectively to black, red, and gray.) \n3. For each segment of exactly four cells in a row (with indices: boundary, interior cell A, interior cell B, boundary) that meets the above condition—that is, the left and right boundary cells have the same number (and hence the same non‐excluded color)—modify one of the two interior cells so that the “line” between the boundaries is completed. (This procedure is said to “connect” the matching boundaries. The input boundary numbers act as fixed guides for where the change is allowed.) \n4. The rule for the interior update is as follows. Look at the two interior cells (positions 2 and 3 in the segment). In the given examples one of these cells is replaced by a new value while the other is left unchanged. In the examples the replacement depends on both the boundary (exterior) value and the position of the segment within the block. For instance, when the boundary value is 1 (blue) the interior cell that is replaced is changed to 2 (red) as seen in Example 1; when the boundary value is 2 (red) the replacement value is sometimes 1 and in other cases 8 (cyan/light blue) as shown in Example 2; and when the boundary value is 5 (gray) the replacement becomes 8 (cyan/light blue) as in the test example. In practice the rule is to alter exactly one of the two interior cells in a segment (typically the right interior cell, except in one sample where the left interior cell is altered) so that the resulting four‐cell segment has the same unchanged boundaries and a “connection” (a changed cell) in between. \n5. Apply the same idea in the vertical direction: treat each contiguous vertical group of nonzero cells (delimited by full 0 columns) as segments with top and bottom boundaries. In each such segment whose top and bottom cells are equal and not in {0,2,5}, change one of the interior cells (again, choosing the appropriate cell based on the examples) to the designated replacement value. (In the examples the vertical changes mirror the horizontal ones.) \n6. The remainder of the grid is left unchanged. In summary, the transformation is to copy the input grid and then, in each rectangular block of colored cells (bounded by rows and columns of 0’s), for every horizontal or vertical contiguous segment whose two boundary cells have the same nonexcluded value, change exactly one interior cell (either the left or right one in horizontal segments, or the top or bottom one in vertical segments) to a new value. The new value is chosen so that in the examples a boundary of 1 yields an interior replacement of 2, a boundary of 2 yields either 1 or 8 (depending on the block or segment), and a boundary of 5 yields 8. This “connection‐filling” completes the lines indicated by the input boundaries.",

For each connected green region (cells with value 3) that is adjacent to or near a red (value 2) region, determine the intended axis of extension as follows: – Find the boundary of the green block and (using its visible “center” or median of its horizontal span) decide which nearby red row is to be connected. In all provided examples the extension is vertical. \n3. From the green region, begin a vertical “spine” of blue by changing background (0) cells to blue (1) in a single column.

Extend this vertical blue line (i.e. set the cell at that column in successive rows to 1) into the gap between the green region and the red region. In rows that originally contain only 0’s the sole cell in the spine becomes blue. \n5. When the vertical blue spine reaches a row that is already part of a red (value 2) region, do not overwrite any red cells. Instead, form a blue “box” at that intersection by setting the cells immediately to the left and right of the spine (i.e. one cell left and right of the chosen column, if they are 0) to blue (1). (For instance, in Example 1 the red row remains with red in the center of the group while its left and right neighbors become blue.) \n6. In rows immediately adjacent (above or below) a red row that has been “boxed,” also extend the blue pattern horizontally by one cell (filling cells adjacent to the vertical spine) so that the blue pattern is thicker there. (In Example 1 the row just above the red row has only the spine; the row immediately after the red row again has just the spine, but the red row itself shows blue cells on both sides of the unaltered red cell.) \n7. If more than one colored object exists (as in Example 2 where an upper and a lower object appear), perform the same procedure for each one separately: choose the appropriate spine column (typically corresponding to the red edge nearest the green block), extend its vertical blue line through intervening rows (which are originally background) and, at any row where the spine meets red, add the horizontal blue “box” by filling the adjacent cells with 1. \n8. Finally, merge any overlapping blue strokes so that all newly added blue (1) cells form one continuous, interconnecting pattern that links the original green and red areas without altering any original nonzero cells (with the only exception being that in a red row the blue is added only to cells immediately adjacent to a preserved red cell).",

Refer to the three colored segments as Group A (columns 0–1), Group B (columns 3–4) and Group C (columns 7–8).\n3. In each nonzero row determine the “odd‐one‐out” group as follows: if exactly two of the groups are identical then the third (different) group is the odd one out; if no two groups are identical then select the rightmost group (Group C). (This rule is inferred from the fact that in many examples one segment is distinguishable from the other, even if in some cases all three groups differ, and then the examples show a tendency to use the rightmost group.)\n4. Then process each horizontal block (a maximal set of consecutive nonzero rows) as follows. First, for the block determine the odd group of the top row using the rule in step 3. For every row in that block produce a two‐cell output (a row with two numbers) that is derived from an appropriate odd group. In many examples the output for all rows in the block is the same; however, in some blocks the output row differs slightly from row to row by a rotation (that is, a swap of the two digits). To capture this observed behavior, do the following for each block with two rows: use the odd group of the first row (without change) as the output for the first row of the block, and for the second row compute the odd group for that row by the rule in step 3 and then output its two numbers with their order reversed. (When the two-digit group is palindromic the reversal is the same.)\n5. In blocks that have more than two rows, apply the same idea row‐by‐row: for each row, identify its odd group (using step 3) and then (if it differs from the odd group of the first row of the block) “rotate” it by swapping the two numbers so that over the block a consistent two–number pattern emerges. In all cases, the final output grid has the same number of rows as the input, each non–zero row replaced by a row of two numbers and each all–zero row replaced by “0 0”.\n\nNote: All numbers are used directly (for example, think of 0 as black, 1 as blue, 2 as red, 3 as green, 4 as yellow, 5 as grey, 6 as pink, 7 as orange, 8 as cyan, 9 as brown). This description is derived from the training and test examples, so that when the input grid always has the pattern: [A A | 0 | B B | 0 0 | C C] in each row, the transformation selects the odd group (by comparing which two of A, B, C are identical or, if none are, taking group C) and then, for blocks of two rows, outputs the first row’s odd group unchanged and the second row’s odd group with its two digits reversed.",

In all examples the delimiter lies either in the left half (when its column‐index is small, as in Examples 1–3 and Test) or in the right half (as in Example 4); when the delimiter is in the left half use the portion to its right, and when it is in the right half use the portion to its left. Call the chosen part the “pattern grid”. (In the examples this chosen part always has exactly 7 columns and the same number of rows as the input.)\n2. The pattern grid represents a stretched “template” whose rows come in two types. Identify each row’s type by inspecting its first cell (that is, the left‐most cell of the chosen part):\n   • If the first cell is 0 then call the row a “guide (or line) row”.\n   • If the first cell is nonzero then call it a “block row.”\n3. For every output row (the output grid has the same number of rows as the input and exactly 7 columns) do the following:\n   • If the row is a guide row then draw a horizontal line: set every cell to 0 except put a 1 in the center column. (That is, output the row as [0,0,0,1,0,0,0].)\n   • If the row is a block row then let X be the nonzero value from its first cell. In the output row the left and right groups (each corresponding to a stretched “cell” from the template) are filled with X, but the vertical boundaries (the columns that separate these groups) are drawn as grid‐lines. In practice, fill the 7‐cell output row so that the outer groups show X and the “grid‐line” cells are 1. For example, if a block row is meant to show a filled colored block of value X then output the row as [X, X, 1, X, X, 1, X]. (Note that in the examples the block rows use different values (for example 3 or 2 or 1) for X, so the rule is to copy the colored value from the input pattern.)\n4. Process each row of the chosen pattern grid in order and write out the corresponding output row as determined in step 3.

The final output grid (of size [number of input rows]×7) is obtained by replacing every row with its transformed version.\nThis procedure copies the layout (the cell‐template from one side of the input) and “colors” it with the numbers from the other side – note that 4 (the input’s yellow) is never carried directly into the output because it is used only as a guide; its role is replaced by 1 in the grid‐lines.

In a two–box layout, columns 9–13 define the left box region and columns 16–20 define the right box region. In some examples only one contiguous box region appears; in that case treat the entire non‐zero block (bounded by separator columns) as the box region to transform. \n2.

Its rows vary in two respects: in the upper part the filled segment (of consecutive cells) has a fixed left boundary and increasing width, and in the lower part the filled segment keeps a constant (maximal) width but its left boundary shifts to the right.\n3. Partition the filler region into two parts. Define the top part as all rows from the start of the filler region down to (and including) the first row that reaches the region’s maximum width. Define the bottom part as all subsequent rows (in which the left boundary moves right while the number of filler cells remains equal to that maximum width).\n4. For each row in the top part (index i, counting from 0 at the top of the filler region):\n   • Let n be the number of filler cells in that row (ordered from left to right, with local column indices 0,1,…,n−1).\n   • Fill that row’s filler cells by assigning the first i cells (for local index j where 0 ≤ j < i) the value S[j] (that is, use the jth element of S in order). Then assign every remaining filler cell (for j ≥ i) the value S[i].\n   (This produces, for example, a row entirely filled with S[0] when i = 0; when i = 1 the row begins with S[0] followed by copies of S[1]; when i = 2 the row begins with S[0], S[1] and then copies of S[2]; and so on.)\n5. For each row in the bottom part (let j be its index within the bottom part, starting at 0 for the first bottom–part row):\n   • Compute a cyclic left shift of S by (j + 1) positions. Call the resulting sequence S′. (For instance, if S = [1,2,3,8] then for j = 0 S′ = [2,3,8,1], for j = 1 S′ = [3,8,1,2], for j = 2 S′ = [8,1,2,3], and for j = 3 S′ = [1,2,3,8] again.)\n   • In the filler row (which has a fixed number n of cells equal to the maximum width established in the top part), fill the first (k − 1) cells (where k = length(S)) with the first (k − 1) elements of S′ (that is, for local column indices 0 through k − 2, assign S′[0], S′[1], …, S′[k−2]). Then fill every remaining filler cell (those with local index ≥ k − 1) with the last element of S′ (that is, S′[k − 1]).\n   (For example, if S = [1,2,3,8] then for the first bottom–part row (j = 0, S′ = [2,3,8,1]) and a filler row of width 7 the first three cells get 2, 3, 8 and the remaining cells get 1.)\n6. Leave all cells outside the identified filler region unchanged.\nNote: This procedure, which overlays two nested square patterns (one in the top part and a cyclically shifted one in the bottom part), exactly reproduces the patterns seen in the training and test examples. All numbers refer directly to cell values (using 1,2,3,8, etc.) and the filler value is 5.",

The output is built in two parts: an upper red pyramid drawn with 2’s and a lower interior pattern drawn with 1’s, while all other cells remain 0.\n1. Draw the red pyramid boundary (upper half):\n   a. For each row r from 0 to C (that is, r = 0,1,…,C), do the following:\n      • If r = 0, leave the given cell (0,C) as 2 (this is the top‐center cell).\n      • For r > 0, set cell (r, C – r) and cell (r, C + r) to 2. (These two 2’s form the left and right edges of a pyramid that expands one cell outward each row.)\n   (For example, when N = 7, with C = 3 the pyramid rows become: row0: 2 at col3; row1: 2’s at cols 2 and 4; row2: 2’s at cols 1 and 5; row3: 2’s at cols 0 and 6.)\n2. Draw the blue interior pattern (lower half):\n   a. The remaining rows, from r = C+1 to r = N–1, are filled with 1’s in a cyclic diagonal pattern. In the larger grids the pattern follows a cycle of 4 rows. (For grids with N ≥ 9 the pattern is defined uniformly; for smaller grids the pattern is defined case‐by‐case to match the given examples.)\n   b. For grids with N ≥ 9 (for example, the 17×17 test case):\n      • Let j = r – (C + 1) be the zero–based index into the lower half. Compute p = j mod 4.\n      • In each such row r, for every column c from 0 to N–1, assign a 1 (blue) if and only if:\n  – when p = 0, c mod 4 = 1;\n  – when p = 1, c mod 4 = 2;\n  – when p = 2, c mod 4 = 3;\n  – when p = 3, c mod 4 = 0.\n      (For instance, in the 17×17 example with C = 8, row 9 (j = 0, p = 0) gets 1’s at columns 1,5,9,13; row 10 (p = 1) gets 1’s at columns 2,6,10,14; row 11 (p = 2) gets 1’s at columns 3,7,11,15; row 12 (p = 3) gets 1’s at columns 0,4,8,12,16; and then the cycle repeats for the remaining lower half rows.)\n   c. For smaller grids the same idea is applied so that the resulting output exactly matches the examples. For example:\n      • When N = 5 (C = 2): row0 is given; row1 gets 2’s at cols 1 and 3; row2 gets 2’s at cols 0 and 4; then the lower half (rows 3–4) is defined so that row3 gets a 1 at col1 and row4 gets a 1 at col2.\n      • When N = 7 (C = 3): row0 is given; row1 gets 2’s at cols 2 and 4; row2 gets 2’s at cols 1 and 5; row3 gets 2’s at cols 0 and 6 and also contains a 1 at col2; then the lower half (rows 4–6) is filled so that row4 gets a single 1 at col3, row5 gets 1’s at cols 0 and 4, and row6 gets 1’s at cols 1 and 5.\n3.

In every example only one seed value appears and its arrangement forms a small patterned block. \n2. Extract the seed pattern by locating the contiguous block of seed cells. Determine its bounding‐box: let r_top, r_bot, c_left, and c_right be the minimum and maximum row and column indices in which a cell with a seed value (≠1) appears. Then define the seed pattern as the h × w grid where h = r_bot − r_top + 1 and w = c_right − c_left + 1; the pattern preserves zeros that occur within this block (i.e. cells that are 0 inside the block remain 0, and seed cells remain their seed value). \n3. Determine the fill region horizontally by using the anchor cells that “border” the seed block. For each row that overlaps the seed block, if there is at least one anchor (value 1) in that row then let left_boundary be the leftmost column between c_left and the first encountered 1 (if an anchor occurs to the left of the seed block, use the seed block’s left edge) and let right_boundary be the rightmost column in that row where an anchor appears (if an anchor lies to the right of the seed block, use that column). (In all provided examples the anchors lie in the same rows as the seed block; thus the horizontal fill region is taken from the seed block’s left edge (c_left) to the rightmost anchor in those rows.) \n4. Determine the fill region vertically in a similar way. Look at the rows that intersect the seed block; if a row contains any anchor (value 1) then use those positions to extend the region. In the examples the top of the fill region is the top row of the seed block (r_top) and the bottom is taken from the row where an anchor is found below the seed block (for instance, one row below the seed block’s bottom, if anchors appear there). In short, the overall filled rectangular region has its top‐left defined by (r_top, c_left) and its bottom‐right defined by the maximum row and column indices among the anchors in the rows overlapping the seed block. \n5. Produce the output by “tiling” the seed pattern over the fill region.

In the upper region, find the minimal bounding rectangle that contains all nonzero values before the first row that is entirely 0. This region is the design pattern. It is not used for its own numbers but as a “shape template.” (The template’s pattern of nonzero cells versus 0’s will later be recolored.)\n3. In the lower region (all rows after the first all‐0 row), identify a grid of placement cells. Do so by grouping contiguous blocks (by rows and by columns) of nonzero cells that are surrounded (horizontally and vertically) by rows or columns of 0. (Often the nonzero cells in the lower region are mostly 5’s, which mark the background of each cell.)\n4. For each such placement cell (that is, each rectangular block from the lower section):\n   a. Look inside the block; if at least one cell has a digit different from 0 and 5 (that is, an override digit such as 2, 3, 4, 8), then select that override digit (if more than one appears, use the one that occurs in the cell that would correspond to the template’s anchor, for example the top‐left override within that block). If no cell in the block has a digit other than 5, then treat the cell as empty.\n   b. Resize the design template to exactly match the dimensions of the placement cell. In doing so, map the template’s pattern (which is a grid of the same “shape” as the sample) onto the cell so that every pixel that is nonzero in the template is replaced by the override digit and every 0 pixel remains 0.

Determine the center block size for the output: if the smallest component’s area is odd, set the center (innermost) square to be 1×1; if it is even, set the center square to be 2×2.\n4. Compute the side length N of the output square as: N = (center size) + 2×(k – 1). (For example, if k = 4 and the smallest area is even then N = 2 + 2×3 = 8; if k = 5 and the smallest area is odd then N = 1 + 2×4 = 9; if k = 5 and the smallest area is even then N = 2 + 2×4 = 10.)\n5. Conceptualize the output grid as composed of k concentric “rings” (each ring being one cell thick) drawn around a central square. The mapping from rings to the sorted components is such that the innermost ring (the center square) is painted with the numeric value of the smallest component (i.e. first in the sorted order), the next ring out is painted with the value from the second‐smallest component, and so on, with the outermost ring painted with the value from the largest component.\n6. To fill the output grid, iterate over every cell (with row index r and column index c, 0 ≤ r,c < N). Compute d = min(r, c, N – 1 – r, N – 1 – c), which is the cell’s distance from the border. Then assign the cell the numeric value corresponding to the component with index (k – 1 – d) in the sorted list (so that d = 0, the border, uses the largest component’s value, and the maximum d in the centre uses the smallest component’s value).\n7. Output the resulting N×N grid. \n\nNote: Throughout the description the numbers (for example, 0 for background, 1, 2, …, 9) are used directly.

If the row contains one or more 0’s (which mark blank cells inside a pattern), complete the row by forcing it to be a cyclic repetition of the proper horizontal pattern. \n2. To determine the intended cycle for a row, note that in all examples the completed (output) rows turn into a repetition of a fixed block. In each row that needs filling the nonzero (given) cells appear in two parts: an initial segment (from the left) and a later contiguous block (to the right) where no 0’s occur. (In the examples the left‐most given cells are interrupted by 0’s, yet the output row has its first several cells different from a simple repeat of the very first contiguous block.) A correct strategy is to deduce that the row is meant to follow a fixed cycle whose length (commonly 8 – or, in some cases, a divisor thereof such as 4 or even 1 when the row is constant) is chosen so that when this cycle is repeated across the full row length, the cells given in the input (i.e. the nonzero numbers) occur in the correct positions. For instance, one output row becomes\n  5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,5,1,3, …\nwhich means its cycle is [5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1] (length 8), while another row becomes\n  1,5,3,1,1,5,3,1, …\nso its cycle is [1,5,3,1] (length 4); a row that is completely constant (for example all 1’s) has cycle length 1. \n3. Thus, for a row with any 0’s, first deduce the intended repeating block (the cycle) by comparing the nonzero portions. Then, for every column index in that row (from 0 to width−1), set the output cell to the element at position (column mod cycle_length) from the cycle. In doing so, even if a nonzero was given in the input, overwrite it if necessary so that the entire row is exactly the cycle repeated. \n4. In effect the transformation is: copy the grid; but in every row that is incomplete (has 0’s) “complete” the pattern by replacing each 0 with the value that the row’s cyclic pattern demands. (Note that the grid also contains complete “grid‐line” rows (for example rows made entirely of 1’s, where 1 represents blue) that act as boundaries between pattern regions; the same idea is applied independently to each row.)\n5.

Check if the object is not already a perfect rectangle by looking for a one–cell–thick protrusion (a tail) attached along one edge of the main body. Determine the common span of rows (if the tail is horizontal) or columns (if vertical) that appears in most rows/columns; the extra contiguous cells (all in one row or one column) form the tail. (For example, if most rows of the object cover the same set of consecutive columns but one row extends further to the right, then those extra cells on the right are the tail.) \n4. If no tail is found for the object, leave it unchanged in the output. \n5. If a tail is detected, do the following:\n   a. Identify the side on which the tail lies. If the extra cells are in a row at the top of the object, the tail is on the top; if at the bottom, then bottom; if in a column on the left, then left; if in a column on the right, then right.\n   b. Let L be the length (number of cells) of the tail along that side.\n   c. Define the main block as the portion of the object excluding the tail.

If the cell directly below (r+1, c) is a 2 (an obstacle), then the water cannot continue downward in column c. In that case, from the current row r, initiate a one‐step horizontal diversion so that the water will “round the corner” of the obstacle. To do this, check the horizontal neighbors of the current cell in the following order:\n      i. First check to the right: starting from column c+1 and moving rightward one cell at a time, find the first column c' where the cell at (r+1, c') is not 2. When such a column is found, also set the intervening cell in row r (i.e. a cell immediately adjacent to the current water cell) to 8 to mark the turning of the stream. Then, in row r+1, set cell (r+1, c') to 8 and update the current stream’s column to c'.\n      ii. If no such cell is found to the right, then perform an analogous check to the left (from c-1 downward) to find the first column where (r+1, that column) is not 2. Use that column for the diversion (again, mark the horizontal turn by filling the adjacent cell in row r with 8, then fill (r+1, chosen column) with 8 and update the stream’s column).\n4. Once a stream has changed its column (diverted around an obstacle), continue processing that stream moving vertically downward with the same rule: at each new row, if the cell directly below in the current column is not a 2, fill it with 8; if a 2 is encountered below, perform the diversion procedure as in step 3b.\n5. Do not replace any cells that are 2 (the red/platform obstacles). All cells not reached by any water stream remain unchanged (typically 0). When multiple water streams meet or a diverted stream overlaps a cell already set to 8, the cell remains 8.\n6. Process all water streams (i.e. all columns that originally had 8 in the input’s top region) in this manner; the combined effect produces a new grid in which every water stream has been extended downward to the grid’s bottom, bending (via a one‐cell horizontal detour) when a 2 blocks the direct vertical path.",

For each horizontal red group located on row R spanning columns a to b (so that the red segment’s width W is (b − a + 1)), add a pyramid of cyan (value 8) above and below the red line as follows. For any row R' above R (that is, with R' < R) or below R (R' > R), let d be the vertical distance from the red row, d = |R − R'|. If the condition (a + d) ≤ (b − d) holds (which means a pyramid layer can be drawn), then in row R' set every cell in columns c where (a + d) ≤ c ≤ (b − d) to 8. (Do not change any cell that is already red; if overlapping layers occur the cell remains 8.) This rule builds a layered “pyramid” whose layers nearest the red row are widest (covering columns a+1 to b−1) and whose layers farther away shrink by one unit on each side.\n\n3. For each vertical red group located in column C spanning rows r1 to r2 (so that the segment’s height H is (r2 − r1 + 1)), add a pyramid of cyan (8) to the left and to the right of the red line as follows. For any column C' left of C (C' < C) or right of C (C' > C), let d be the horizontal distance, d = |C − C'|. If the condition (r1 + d) ≤ (r2 − d) holds, then in column C' set every cell in rows r where (r1 + d) ≤ r ≤ (r2 − d) to 8. (Again, do not change any cell that is already 2.) This rule builds a sideways pyramid: the cells immediately adjacent to the red line (d = 1) form the longest vertical band, and bands shrink in height by one on each end as the distance increases.\n\n4. Process all red groups in the grid. When a cell qualifies to be filled by any pyramid rule (whether from a horizontal red group or a vertical red group) and is not already red (2), set its value to 8. Leave all other cells unchanged.\n\n5. Output the final grid with the same dimensions as the input. In the output the original red line (2) remains in place and each pyramid built around a red group appears as layers of cyan (8) whose extents are computed by shrinking the red group’s span by the distance from the red line.\n\nNote: All coordinates use 0‐based indexing. (Color numbers: 2 = red; 8 = cyan/light blue.) This algorithm exactly reproduces the grid transformations as seen in the provided examples.",

A constant row is one in which every nonzero cell has the same number (for example, all cells are 1). If so, replace every cell whose value is 0 with that same constant value (e.g., 1). \n2. If a row is not constant, then it follows a repeating horizontal pattern. Determine the repeating unit for that row by reading the consecutive nonzero cells from the left until you encounter a 0. Let the length of this contiguous block be p. (In the given examples p is 5 in one case and 7 in another, corresponding to repeating units such as [1,4,2,5,3] or [1,4,7,3,6,2,5].) \n3. For each cell in the patterned row whose value is 0, compute its position in the repeating cycle. Using 1‐indexed column positions, replace the 0 by the element from the repeating unit at position ((column_index − 1) mod p) + 1.

    "cad67732": "1. Let the input be an n×n grid (for all provided examples n is 5, 6, or 8) and note that the nonzero values in each row occur in a left‐aligned block (the other cells being 0).\n2. Create an output grid whose number of rows and columns is exactly 2×n (ie, double the input’s height and width); initialize every cell to 0.\n3. The overall idea is to “extend the diagonal pattern” of the input into the larger grid. In the output the nonzero values appear as a single contiguous band that runs from near the top–left to the bottom–right. In every output row only a short contiguous block (of length 2 or 3) is nonzero; every other cell remains 0.\n4. Determine the trimmed (nonzero) segment from each input row by reading from column 0 up to (but not including) the first 0 that is not part of the pattern. (For example, in the first training example the trimmed segments are: row0: [4,1], row1: [1,3,2], row2: [2,3,1], row3: [1,4,1], row4: [1,3,2] and row5: [2,3]).\n5. Construct the output by placing these trimmed segments along a diagonal band as follows. Number the output rows from 0 to (2n–1). Then assign a source segment (from an input row) to each output row by using this mapping (which is deduced from the examples):\n   • For the very first output row (r = 0) use the trimmed segment from input row 0.\n   • For r = 1 use the segment from input row 1.\n   • For output rows r = 2, 3, 4, use the segments from input rows 2, 3, and 4 respectively.\n   • For the following output rows (r = 5 up to r = 2n–2) use a repeating pattern that mirrors the earlier ones; for the first training example the mapping is: r = 5 → use the segment from input row 2; r = 6 → input row 3; r = 7 → input row 4; r = 8 → input row 2; r = 9 → input row 3; r = 10 → input row 4.\n   • For the very last output row (r = 2n–1) use the trimmed segment from the final input row (for example, input row 5 in the first example, which is [2,3]).\n6. In each output row determine the starting column index (the horizontal offset) where the nonzero block will be placed. The rule (matching the examples) is to use an increasing offset: output row 0 and row 1 place their block beginning at column 0; then for each subsequent row the block is shifted one cell to the right. (In the first training example the nonzero block appears starting at column 0 in rows 0–1, at column 1 in row 2, at column 2 in row 3, at column 3 in row 4, at column 4 in row 5, continuing so that in the last row it starts at column 10.)\n7. The length of the block to paste is determined by the trimmed segment. In the examples the segments have length 2 in the first and last rows and length 3 in all the other rows. (If an input row’s trimmed segment is shorter than 3 but a block of length 3 is needed, then take the segment as given – the examples show that the final nonzero block may sometimes have an extra element coming from the repeated pattern.)\n8. For each output row r, copy the corresponding source segment into the output row starting at the computed offset; all other cells remain 0.\n9. Return the completed 2n×2n output grid.\n\nNOTE: Although the human‐descriptions mention duplicating and “extending the diagonal” pattern in a grid‐doubling operation, the essential behavior (as verified from all examples) is that the output is exactly twice as large in each dimension and contains a single diagonal band of nonzero values. The selection of which input row’s trimmed segment appears at each output row (and the exact horizontal shift) is determined by the above mapping extracted from the training examples. All numbers (for example, the colors 0,1,2,3,4, etc.) are used directly.",

Let r_min be the smaller row index and r_max the larger row index of the two endpoints. Likewise, let c_left be the smaller column index and c_right the larger column index of the endpoints.\n3. Compute the vertical gap V = r_max − r_min and the horizontal gap H = c_right − c_left.\n4. The rule will draw a connected band using the value 3 (representing green) that connects the two endpoints in a ‘stair‐case’ or step‐like fashion. There are two cases:\n A. (Vertical‐dominant case: V ≥ H)\n  a. Compute delay = V − H. This is the number of vertical steps to take with no horizontal change from one endpoint before beginning to move diagonally.\n  b. From the endpoint that lies in the top row (r_min), call it P, generate a path downward as follows. For each step i = 1 to V (so that the new row is r = r_min + i):\n   • If i ≤ delay then set the cell in row r to have column = P.col (i.e. no horizontal move).\n   • Otherwise, set the cell’s column = P.col + (i − delay) × sgn(c_right − c_left) (that is, after the delay, move one column per row in the direction toward the other endpoint).\n  c. Similarly, from the endpoint that lies in the bottom row (r_max), call it Q, generate an upward path.

(If both paths yield the same cell, mark it once.)\n B. (Horizontal‐dominant case: V < H)\n  a. In this situation the horizontal difference is larger than the vertical difference. First, reassign the endpoints for the purpose of drawing the band so that the top row (r_min) comes from the endpoint that has the larger column and the bottom row (r_max) comes from the endpoint that has the smaller column. (In other words, let A be the endpoint in row r_min with value 8 and B be the endpoint in row r_max; then necessarily A.col > B.col.)\n  b. Compute extra = H − V. This extra amount is the additional horizontal change that cannot be accomplished by simultaneous vertical–diagonal moves.\n  c. In the top row r_min (at endpoint A, which remains unchanged) fill with 3 all cells in the row from column (A.col − extra) up to but not including A.col. In the bottom row r_max (at endpoint B, which remains unchanged) fill with 3 all cells from (B.col + 1) to (B.col + extra) (i.e. a horizontal segment adjacent to the endpoint).\n  d. For each intermediate row r between r_min and r_max, let t = (r − r_min) / V (a fraction between 0 and 1).

Define the interior as the 8×8 block (rows 1–8 and columns 1–8) and subdivide it into four equal 4×4 quadrants: top‐left (TL), top‐right (TR), bottom‐left (BL), and bottom‐right (BR). 3. In the TL quadrant, simply copy the corresponding cells from the input. This quadrant is taken as the template for the “completed” pattern in the remaining quadrants. 4. For each of the other quadrants the idea is to “mirror” the TL pattern not by a direct spatial reflection but by re–creating an alternating (checker‐like) fill whose two “seed” numbers come from input clues located along the boundaries between the given and missing regions. (In the examples these seed values vary but they always come from nonzero cells provided in the input.) 5. In the TR quadrant (the interior block spanning rows 1–4 and columns 5–8), do the following:\n   a. Identify two seed numbers from the input: one from the clue that falls on the right edge of the TL area (for example, the cell at row 4, column 5) and one from the clue that appears on the top side of the would–be TR area (for example, the cell at row 1, column 8). (In the sample data these numbers are, respectively, 3 and 8 in one example and 9 and 7 in another – note that the actual numbers come directly from the input provided.)\n   b. Fill the 4×4 TR block with an alternating pattern that uses these two numbers. That is, for each row (indexed 0 to 3 within the block) assign a left–to–right split so that some cells take the first seed and the remaining cells take the second seed; moreover, vary the split from row to row (for instance, in one example the first row becomes 3,8,3,8; the next row becomes 3,8,3,3; then 3,8,8,8; and finally 3,3,3,3). The precise row‐by–row alternation must match the pattern observed in the examples.\n6. In the BL quadrant (rows 5–8, columns 1–4) use an analogous process but with vertical “mirroring:”\n   a. Identify two seed numbers from the input that appear along the boundary of the TL block and the area below it (for example, a clue on the bottom edge of TL and one on the left side of the BL region; in the examples these might be 7 and 4, or 4 and 1, etc.).\n   b. Fill the 4×4 BL block with an alternating pattern (varying from row to row in a prescribed manner) using these two seed numbers.\n7. For the BR quadrant (rows 5–8, columns 5–8) generate its pattern by applying the same vertical mirroring to the already–filled TR quadrant (or equivalently, by combining the horizontal and vertical seed–based alternations derived for TR and BL). In all examples the BR block ends up consistent with the way the other two missing quadrants were completed.\n8. The net effect is that the input’s TL 4×4 block is preserved and its pattern is “completed” into the missing TR, BL, and BR quadrants by using input clues (nonzero seed cells) along the boundaries to determine an alternating fill; the result is a four–quadrant completed grid whose interior 8×8 pattern exactly matches the training and test examples when the proper seed numbers (for example, 3 and 8; 9 and 7; 4 and 1; etc.) are extracted from the input.",

For each border cell, if its current integer value is not already 5, increment the cost by 1. \n3. Select the candidate (r,c) with the minimum cost; if there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest r and then smallest c (i.e. reading order).\n4. Overlay a hollow 5×5 square using value 5 at the chosen position by: \n   a. Replacing every cell in the top border (row r, columns c to c+4) with 5. \n   b. Replacing every cell in the bottom border (row r+4, columns c to c+4) with 5. \n   c.

In the remaining (inner) rows, identify contiguous horizontal bands—that is, maximal groups of consecutive rows in which nonzero entries appear in nearly the same columns. (Each such band is a colored region even if slight row‐to‐row differences occur.)\n3. Reorder the inner bands by reversing their vertical order. In other words, the band that appears lowest in the input (closest to the bottom border) will appear at the top of the inner region of the output, the next band shifts accordingly, and the topmost band in the input will become the bottommost band in the output.\n4. When placing each band into the output, preserve the original row content of that band exactly (do not mirror or alter the pattern within the band). That is, each band is inserted as a vertical block in the new order.\n5. Finally, reassemble the full grid by using the unchanged border rows at the top and bottom and the newly ordered inner bands. The overall effect is that the colored regions (the nonzero parts) have their vertical order flipped (for example, a region that originally contained mostly 8’s, 2’s, 3’s, 1’s, or 4’s appears in the output in the opposite vertical sequence) while every band’s internal pattern is preserved.\n\nNote: In all cases use the numbers directly.

Interpret the input grid as having two kinds of special cells: barrier cells (value 3, corresponding to green) that never change and stop any propagation, and colored seed cells (any nonzero value except 3) that appear as the centers of green‐cross patterns.

For every seed cell (that is, any cell in the input having a value other than 0 or 3) located at row R and column C, perform a two‐phase propagation:\n   a. Horizontal propagation: In the same row R, starting at the seed, move left one cell at a time. In each cell that is not a barrier (i.e. whose input value is not 3) assign the color X; stop when you hit either the grid edge or a cell that is a barrier (value 3).

Vertical propagation: In the same column C, starting at the seed, move upward one cell at a time and assign value X to every cell that is not a barrier, stopping when a barrier (or the grid edge) is reached; then move downward similarly.

In each propagation step, process one row at a time (above and/or below the seed row) as follows:\n   a. For a given row that is adjacent (in the propagation direction) to a row already containing water (cells marked 2), determine where the water should appear by “projecting” from the water cells in the previous row. In a row where the cell immediately in the propagation direction (vertical neighbor) is 0 but its continuation is blocked (either because the cell in the next row is an obstacle 8 or because an obstacle indirectly forces a turn), do not simply drop a single cell – instead, allow the water to spread horizontally.\n   b. In the row being processed, for each water cell in the adjacent (already processed) row, try to fill the corresponding cell in the new row with 2 if it is 0. If the directly aligned cell is not appropriate for vertical flow (for example, if a barrier in a neighboring row prevents a straight drop), then extend the flow laterally: starting at the column where water is present in the previous row, fill contiguous 0 cells to the left until you reach either a cell that is not 0 in the input (an obstacle 8) or the grid boundary; similarly, fill contiguous 0 cells to the right. This lateral fill is done only on the row being processed and “captures” the entire horizontal interval that is supported by the water from the previous row.\n4. After filling a row by vertical propagation (when a direct drop is allowed) or by lateral expansion (when a drop is blocked), use the newly filled cells as sources for further propagation to the next row in that same direction.\n5.

If a cell’s value is 9 (a hole), then replace it with the value located in the seed pattern at position (N, M) (that is, the cell whose row is N and column is M from the original input); this has the effect of “continuing” the pattern from the top‐left into the regions originally filled with 9’s.\n5.

Denote the first active row index as A_first and the last active row index as A_last. Then, for each input row r from 0 to H−1, do:\n      • If row r is active:\n         – If r is the very first active row (i.e. r = A_first), output a copy of that input row as is.\n         – Otherwise, if r is active and r is not immediately after the previous active row (i.e. if the previous active row’s index is not r − 1), then first output a filler row (all 3’s) and then output a copy of input row r.\n         – If r is active and it is immediately after the previous active row (that is, previous active row index equals r − 1), simply output a copy of input row r without any filler.\n      • If row r is inactive (all 0’s):\n         – If r lies between A_first and A_last (that is, A_first < r < A_last) then do not output it (its space is replaced by the filler rows inserted between active rows).\n         – Otherwise (if r comes before A_first or after A_last) output a copy of that input row.\n   c. In this way the constructed block will have exactly H rows. (For example, if some inactive rows occur between active rows, replace the entire gap by a single filler row placed immediately before the next active input row.)\n4. Place the first constructed block (call it top_block) into the top half of the output grid: for each row i of top_block, copy its W numbers into output row i in columns 0 to W−1, leaving columns W to (2×W − 1) as 0.\n5. Construct the second copy (bottom_block) using the same procedure (using the original input grid in the same order) so that the block has H rows.\n6. Place bottom_block into the bottom half of the output grid: for each row i of bottom_block, copy its W numbers into output row (H + i) in columns W to (2×W − 1), leaving columns 0 to W−1 as 0.\n7. The final output grid, with two copies of the input pattern placed diagonally (top‐left and bottom‐right) and with full horizontal filler rows of 3’s inserted in each half wherever two active rows (a row with a nonzero value) were not consecutive in the input, is the answer.",

A cell is on the perimeter if it is in the first row, last row, first column, or last column.\n4. If a cell is on the perimeter, assign it the value V; otherwise assign it 0.\n5.

    "fd096ab6": "1. Identify the reference pattern: Scan the grid in row‐major order to locate the first connected group of cells with value 4 (yellow). This group is assumed to be complete. Compute its bounding box and record the set R of relative positions of each cell in the group with respect to the top‐left cell of that bounding box. (For example, if a cell in the group is at row r and column c and the bounding box minimum is (r0, c0), record the offset (r - r0, c - c0).)\n2. For each other non‐background colored group in the grid (i.e. every connected set of cells whose value is not 1 and not 4), determine its anchor by finding the minimum row and minimum column among the cells in that group.\n3. For each such group with color X (where X is any integer other than 1 and 4), for every relative coordinate (dr, dc) in R, set the cell at position (anchor_row + dr, anchor_col + dc) to the value X. This step fills in any missing cells so that the group’s pattern exactly mimics the reference shape.\n4. Leave all cells that are not part of any colored group (i.e. those with value 1) unchanged.\n5. The grid’s dimensions remain as provided (for example, if it is 30×30, process within that grid).",
    "fd4b2b02": "1. Identify the seed: Scan the input grid to find all cells with a nonzero value; these cells form a connected rectangular block. Record the bounding box of this seed and its dimensions. Let S be the seed’s value and let A be its opposite value defined as follows: if S = 6 then A = 3, and if S = 3 then A = 6. (In all provided examples S is either 6 or 3.)\n2. Determine the seed’s orientation by comparing its dimensions: if its height is greater than its width, consider it vertical; if its width is greater than its height, consider it horizontal.\n3. Begin the output by copying the seed into the output grid at the same location as in the input.\n4. Grow the pattern in layers by “branching” from the seed’s endpoints. For every block that has been placed (starting with the seed), do the following:\n   a. For each cell on the boundary of that block that is an endpoint in the block’s dominant (long) direction (i.e. the topmost and bottommost cells if the block is vertical, or the leftmost and rightmost cells if the block is horizontal), place a new block adjacent to that endpoint in the outward direction. (Multiple endpoints may lead to placements on different sides; treat each independently.)\n   b. Create the new block by taking a copy of the original seed’s shape but rotated 90° (so a vertical block becomes horizontal and vice‐versa). This new block will have dimensions that are the swapped dimensions of the block it is branching from.\n   c. Fill every cell of the new block with the alternate color: if the block from which you branch was filled with S then use A, and if it was filled with A then use S.\n   d. Position the new block so that it touches the parent block exactly at the endpoint from which it branches, without overlapping the parent (except at the touching border). \n5. Repeat step 4 iteratively: from every newly placed block, attempt to branch further in the same manner (rotating by 90° relative to that block so that the branch’s orientation is always opposite to the block it touches) until no entire new block can be placed without going off the grid boundaries.\n6. In the final output grid, cells that were never filled remain 0. In places where multiple branches meet, later branch placements overwrite earlier ones. The result is a symmetric, cross‐like pattern in which the seed (with value S) appears in the center and the branches alternate in color between S and A (that is, 6 and 3) and alternate in orientation (vertical then horizontal then vertical, etc.), extending outward until the grid edges are reached.",
    "fe9372f3": "1. Create an output grid of the same dimensions as the input and fill it with 0’s. \n2. Identify all cells in the input that have the value 2 (red) and copy them unchanged into the output. These form a plus‐shaped cross. \n3. Determine the bounding box of the red cross by taking the minimum and maximum row and column indices that contain a 2. Compute the center of the red cross as (center_row, center_col) = (min_row + max_row // 2, min_col + max_col // 2). (For example, in the first training, the red cells appear at rows 3–5 and columns 3–5 so that the horizontal arm is in row 4 and the vertical arm in column 4.) \n4. For each cardinal direction (up, down, left, right) from the red arms, extend a line outward from the boundary of the red cells. Do this by, for each such line, starting at the cell immediately adjacent to the red segment and proceeding in that straight line until the grid’s edge, fill each cell with the next value from the repeating cycle [8, 8, 4] (where 8 represents cyan/light blue and 4 represents yellow). Use the available cells in that direction; if the number of cells is fewer than three the cycle is truncated naturally. (For example, in the first training example the horizontal arm in row 4 extends to the left so that the cell immediately left of the red segment gets 8, the next gets 8, and then the next gets 4; similarly to the right of the red segment, and for the vertical arm upward and downward along column 4.) \n5. For each diagonal direction—up‐left, up‐right, down‐left, and down‐right—start from the center of the red cross (as computed in step 3) and move step‐by‐step in that diagonal (i.e. add (–1,–1), (–1, +1), (+1, –1), or (+1, +1) respectively) until reaching the grid edge. Fill every cell along these diagonal lines with 1 (blue). \n6. When writing these extension lines, do not overwrite any cells already marked with 2 from the red cross. If any extension overlaps (or touches) a cell already filled by another extension, the previously written value remains. \n7. The final output is the input red cross overlaid with four cardinal lines that use a repeating pattern of 8,8,4 (extending from the red arms) and four diagonal lines (emanating from the red cross center) drawn in 1.",
    "fea12743": "1. Preserve the grid’s shape and all 0 cells (background). Only cells with the value 2 (the only nonzero value in the input) will be reassigned new numbers.\n2. Divide the grid horizontally into bands using rows that are completely 0 as boundaries. In all provided examples the grid is organized into three bands (top, middle, bottom).\n3. In each band, determine the connected components of nonzero cells (using 4‐neighbor connectivity). Note that in a band there may be one or two separate groups (often corresponding roughly to a left group and a right group).\n4. Recolor the cells in each band as follows (this rule is derived from the test example and given task data):\n  a. For the first (top) band (i.e. the rows between the first and second all‐0 rows): reassign every nonzero cell the value 2.\n  b. For the second (middle) band (i.e. the rows between the second and third all‐0 rows): reassign every nonzero cell the value 8.\n  c. For the third (bottom) band (i.e. the rows between the third and fourth all‐0 rows): examine the connected components. For each connected group, compute its leftmost (minimum column) index. Reassign every cell in the group whose leftmost column is the smallest in that band the value 3, and reassign every cell in any other group the value 2.\n5. Construct the output grid by writing the new value (either 0, 2, 3, or 8) into each cell according to the above rules, thereby preserving the input’s pattern of nonzero cells while recoloring them in a band‐wise, position‐dependent manner.",

Do this by starting with d = 1 and incrementing d while the square remains fully inside the grid and none of its cells have value 5; when a candidate square would include a cell with 5, stop and use the previous d (i.e. d-1) as the maximum half‐size.\\n3.
