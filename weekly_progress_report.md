# rSTAR meets ARC
## Weekly progress report

### Week 1 (03.03.2025)

- **Work planned**: 
  - Do some more research on ARC and rSTAR
  - Start coding up a bare-bones working version of "Round 1"
    - Decide how to break down code into classes and functions
    - Defined "step format" in tree
  - 


- **Work done**: 
  - Research
  - Started breaking down code into classes and functions
  - Getting a cold (again) in the first week of the project :(


- **Issues and Questions**:
  - Probably LLM fine-tuning and alignment needed before "Round 1" is feasible
  - Would a reasoning model help with making sense of longer prompts and possibly give answers that have the correct format more often?
  - Discuss "step format" in more detail.
  - 


### Week 2 (10.03.2025)

- **Work planned**: 
  - Finish coding up a bare-bones working version of "Round 1"
  - Clean up code and make it as "extendable" as possible

- **Work done**: 
  - Decided on implementing a "one line per step" format
  - 


- **Issues and Questions**:
  - How do I best handle arguments?
  -
